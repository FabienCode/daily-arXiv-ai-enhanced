### [1] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

Method: MMoE模型包含四部分：利用大语言模型增强提及信息，采用多模态编码器提取文本与视觉特征，采用层内及层间专家混合机制动态选择重要特征。

Result: 实验表明，MMoE在多模态实体链接任务上性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MMoE模型有效缓解提及歧义和动态模态选择问题，显著提升多模态实体链接的效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [2] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于协方差的像素-文本损失(CoPT)方法，利用领域无关的文本嵌入提升无监督领域自适应(UDA)语义分割的表现，实现了多项基准测试的新状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督领域自适应方法未充分利用文本的领域无关特性，而语义分割标注难以获取，利用文本嵌入有望解决该问题。

Method: 设计协方差基像素-文本损失CoPT，使用LLM生成的领域描述文本嵌入结合冻结的CLIP模型，促进图像分割编码器学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验显示，使用CoPT训练的模型在UDA语义分割任务中取得了新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 结合领域无关的文本嵌入和协方差损失，CoPT显著提升了UDA语义分割的效果，证明了文本信息在领域适应中的价值。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

### [3] [Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139)
*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对生成图像模型中的机器遗忘技术存在的鲁棒性问题，提出了基于多模态对抗图像提示的攻击框架Recall，验证了当前遗忘方法的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成图像模型的发展带来了内容生成质量提升，但同时引发了伦理、法律等问题，机器遗忘作为解决方案尚未充分评估其在多模态对抗输入下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Recall框架，通过优化多模态对抗图像提示，并结合单个语义相关参考图像指导攻击，提升对预训练模型遗忘机制的攻击效果。

Result: 在十种先进的遗忘方法和多样任务上，Recall表现出更强的对抗攻击效果、计算效率和语义忠实度，显著揭示了现有遗忘技术的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 当前机器遗忘技术在生成图像模型中存在明显安全隐患，亟需开发更鲁棒的遗忘机制以保证模型的安全可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [5] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉-语言任务中的幻觉现象，重点研究不同模态输入间的冲突引发的幻觉问题，并提出了缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs尽管能力强大，但在真实场景中易产生幻觉，这主要源于不同模态输入之间的固有冲突，需深入研究这一现象以提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 构建了多模态模态冲突（MMMC）数据集模拟该现象，并提出基于提示工程、监督微调和强化学习的三种方法缓解幻觉问题；通过大量实验评估各方法优劣。

Result: 强化学习方法在缓解模态冲突导致的幻觉中表现最佳，监督微调方法则表现稳定且有潜力。

Conclusion: 揭示了模态冲突是引发MLLM幻觉的重要原因，为提升多模态模型的稳定性和鲁棒性提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [6] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对无人机在无GNSS环境下自主海上监视和目标船只识别的问题，提出了一种基于YOLOv8检测和特征匹配的方法实现目标定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏全球导航卫星系统支持的情况下，无人机如何凭借自身视觉信息实现对目标船只的自动识别与定位，这是搜索救援和威胁检测等应用的关键挑战。

Method: 利用YOLOv8目标检测模型识别视野内所有船只，结合特征匹配和色调直方图距离分析确定目标船只，继而通过简单几何方法实现目标定位。

Result: 在MBZIRC2023竞赛中的实地实验验证了该方法的有效性，并评估了视角对检测准确性和定位精度的影响，同时与理想情况下的方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: 该方法在无GNSS环境下能够实现自主、准确的目标船只识别与定位，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [7] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的结肠息肉分割网络CL-Polyp，通过对比学习提升编码器的特征提取能力，结合MASPP和CA模块实现多尺度特征融合和边界重建，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的息肉分割方法多依赖编码器-解码器结构和多任务框架，需额外标注数据且受任务相似性限制，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出CL-Polyp网络，利用自监督的对比学习提升编码器表征能力，引入MASPP模块增强多尺度特征融合，CA模块融合低层和上采样特征改善边界重建。

Result: 在Kvasir-SEG、CVC-ClinicDB、CVC-ColonDB、CVC-300和ETIS五个基准数据集上，CL-Polyp均优于最新方法，IoU指标在两大数据集提升0.011和0.020。

Conclusion: CL-Polyp有效提升了结肠息肉分割的性能，无需额外标注数据，适用于临床环境下的息肉影像分析。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

*Arshak Rezvani,Ali Akbari,Kosar Sanjar Arani,Maryam Mirian,Emad Arasteh,Martin J. McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过语义字幕对齐脑电信号，进而使用预训练扩散模型生成图像的视觉解码方法，提升了EEG视觉重建的空间细节和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG在空间细节方面有限，直接从EEG生成图像效果不佳，亟需引入高层语义信息提升视觉重建的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 通过对齐脑电信号与从大语言模型生成的多层次语义字幕（从物体级别到抽象主题），利用基于transformer的编码器进行对比学习，获取字幕嵌入后条件预训练扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 在EEGCVPR数据集上实现了最先进的视觉解码性能，同时其脑电-字幕关联与已知神经认知路径一致，突出了不同语义层次的重要性，显示语义在头皮的拓扑分布。

Conclusion: 结构化的语义中介机制有效促进了EEG脑电信号的认知对齐视觉解码，提升了重建的空间细节和解释性。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

TL;DR: 现有视频生成模型虽有进步，但生成的视频长度有限，且多主体长视频难以保持角色和场景一致性。本文研究了32篇相关论文，总结架构和训练策略，构建新分类体系，对比不同方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法在生成长视频，尤其是多角色长视频时，存在角色一致性和动作连贯性不足的问题，需寻找有效架构与策略提升视频质量和长度。

Method: 系统调研32篇视频生成相关论文，分析并总结其核心架构组件和训练策略，构建全面的新分类体系，并通过对比表格展示不同方法的设计与性能特点。

Result: 提出了覆盖多主体长视频生成的视频生成方法分类体系，明确了高质量长视频生成的关键组件和策略，提供了对现有方法的详细对比分析。

Conclusion: 通过全面总结和分类现有视频生成技术，为未来设计更长且多主体一致性更好的视频生成模型提供了理论基础和实践参考。

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [10] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于颜色信息的服装变化再识别方法CSCI，无需额外标注，利用前景和背景颜色缓解外观偏差，实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统服装变化再识别方法依赖额外模型或标注，资源消耗大，亟需轻量级且无需标注的方法来消除服装外观偏差。

Method: 提出Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI)方法，通过直接利用原始图像的RGB颜色信息，并引入S2A自注意机制分离颜色特征与身份特征，防止信息泄露，保持身份特征纯洁性。

Result: 在四个CC-ReID数据集上，CSCI分别带来基线Top-1准确率提升2.9%至5.0%（图像）和1.0%至2.5%（视频），且无需额外监督。

Conclusion: 颜色作为轻量级无标注的代理特征，有效缓解服装变化带来的外观偏差，是成本效益高的服装变化再识别解决方案。

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

Method: 利用机器学习实现基于文本提示的灵活对象检测、每帧图像的细化分割以及鲁棒的视频追踪以保证时间一致性；通过容器化部署和结构化输出格式快速推广至艺术家使用。

Result: 显著减少了人工工作量，加快了初步合成的制作速度，同时提供了全面的分割数据。

Conclusion: 该自动化视频分割管道有效提升了视觉特效制作的整体效率，受到了艺术家的快速采用。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual
effort, speeds up the creation of preliminary composites, and provides
comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

### [12] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态语言引导框架DisenQ，通过结构化语言指导解耦身份、生物特征、动作和非生物特征，实现跨活动个体识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统身份识别方法在活动多样时受到动作动态和外观变化的干扰，导致身份信息难以准确提取。

Method: 引入DisenQ统一查询变换器，利用结构化语言指导解耦身份、生物和动作特征，替代传统的额外视觉数据输入。

Result: 在三个活动基础的视频基准上取得了最先进的性能，并在传统视频识别场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了活动中个体识别的准确性和鲁棒性，突破了动作与外观变化带来的挑战。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了LinguaMark基准，旨在评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在多语言视觉问答任务中的表现，涵盖11种语言和五个社会属性，通过偏见、答案相关性和可信度三项指标进行评测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型虽然训练于大量图文数据，但语言覆盖有限，导致在多语言环境下存在偏见和不公平表现，亟需针对多语言能力的专门评估。

Method: 构建包含6875对图文数据、涵盖11种语言和五个社会属性的多语言视觉问答数据集LinguaMark，并使用偏见、答案相关性和可信度三个关键指标对多模态模型进行评测。

Result: 封闭源模型通常表现最佳，但开源模型在社会属性评测上表现也具竞争力，尤其是开源模型Qwen2.5展现出优异的多语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: LinguaMark基准和评测代码已开放，促进多语言多模态模型的公平性评估和后续研究，推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令引导图像编辑的自动评价面临公开训练数据集缺乏、开源视觉语言模型对齐困难及专有模型透明度和成本问题。

Method: 采用自动化数据集生成策略ADIEE，生成超过10万样本的评分数据集，并微调改良的LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型，使其能输出数值评分。

Result: 训练的评分模型在多个评价基准上均超越现有开源模型和Gemini-Pro 1.5，评分与人工评价相关性提升17.24%，配对比较准确率分别提升7.21%和9.35%。

Conclusion: 该评分模型不仅优化了图像编辑效果自动评价，还能作为奖励模型，辅助最佳编辑选择和模型微调，显著提升实际应用中MagicBrush模型的评分表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型难以识别不同图片中相同的角色和对象，导致叙事中出现身份不一致和幻觉，缺少相关跨帧实体连接训练。

Method: 通过在故事推理数据集上加入合成负样本，采用对比强化学习和双重奖励函数，训练模型辨别连贯与无关图像序列，并采用直接偏好优化微调视觉故事讲述模型。

Result: 模型的实体定位mAP从0.27提升至0.31，F1值从0.35提升至0.41，代词定位准确率普遍提升，跨帧实体持续性增强，连贯故事比例显著提高。

Conclusion: 通过对比强化学习和数据增强，有效提升了视觉故事中实体的跨帧识别和连贯性，增强了故事的结构完整性和准确性。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

TL;DR: PacGDC通过利用多尺度深度基础模型和数据合成技术，显著提升了泛化深度补全的效率与效果，减少了对大规模标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统泛化深度补全方法依赖大量带深度标签的数据，收集成本高。作者希望以最小的标注工作量提升数据多样性，实现高效泛化。

Method: 基于2D-3D投影中物体形状和位置的矛盾与一致性，PacGDC设计出利用多尺度深度基础模型生成伪几何图像的数据合成流程，通过场景尺度变换、插值和重定位策略扩展数据覆盖，并结合无标签图像。

Conclusion: PacGDC有效提升了深度补全的泛化性和标签效率，是一种适用于未知环境的强大方法。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了粒子形状建模的自适应性和对应一致性，能更准确地量化复杂解剖形变，为相关领域提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络中易获取的不受约束的图像集合存在光照不稳定和瞬态遮挡，导致传统分割方法难以准确分割和复原场景光照。

Method: 基于3D高斯散点，整合多维特征嵌入，通过特征相似度实现3D场景交互式分割，并引入尖刺3D高斯切割器(SGC)平滑异常点，同时投影到2D利用SAM掩码确定切割比例。

Result: Seg-Wild在不受约束的场景分割和重建质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Seg-Wild有效提升了在野外场景中基于网络图像集合的场景分割与重建性能，适合复杂光照和遮挡条件。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Conclusion: EscherNet++在小规模数据集微调条件下，依然实现了最先进的性能，且具备良好的泛化能力，可有效支持真实场景中的遮挡物三维重建。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）和颜色阈值技术的新方法，用于检测皮肤病变中的蓝白色帽（BWV），该特征对黑色素瘤诊断至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑色素瘤是一种致死率极高的皮肤癌，BWV是其关键诊断特征，但针对BWV的检测研究较少。

Method: 利用色彩阈值算法对无标注皮肤病变数据进行标注，设计基于自定义层的DCNN在多个数据集上训练，并结合可解释人工智能（XAI）算法解释模型决策。

Result: 模型在多个增强数据集上测试准确率达85.71%-95.05%，优于现有BWV检测模型，表现出较好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提方法和XAI结合显著提升了BWV检测效果，为早期黑色素瘤诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

Result: 在SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack和RoadAnomaly等关键基准测试中，Objectomaly在像素级（AuPRC高达96.99，FPR95降至0.07）和组件级（F1分数达到83.44）指标上均获得了最先进表现。

Conclusion: Objectomaly框架通过结合目标先验有效提升了越界检测的精度和稳定性，且在真实驾驶视频中表现出良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究首次针对视频跟踪中的数据隐私问题提出有效解决方案，为防止私人视频被非法利用提供了强有力的技术保障。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS有效缓解了低光环境对弱监督语义分割性能的影响，提升了模型的特征表达能力和分割准确率。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多尺度洪水三维映射方法HOTA，结合SegFormer和深度估计模块，实现了高精度大范围洪水映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有洪水信息产品通常在空间细节和覆盖范围之间权衡，且忽视洪水深度，无法满足灾害响应的需求。

Method: 提出HOTA多尺度推理策略，用不同大小重叠瓦片处理哨兵2号多光谱图像，并结合基于DEM差分的双约束深度估计模块，实现洪水范围和深度的联合估计。

Result: 在2021年澳大利亚Kempsey洪灾案例中，方法使IoU从基线的73%提升至84%，边界误差小于0.5米，显著提高了洪水映射的精度。

Conclusion: HOTA方法能够快速生成准确的大范围三维洪水图，具备较强的实际应用价值，适合灾害应急响应。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在空间可视化能力上的评估不足，现有测试多嵌入数学逻辑评估中且可能交叉训练数据，导致评估不可靠。

Method: 构建一个涵盖4个子能力共12个任务的多模态空间可视化基准，自动生成1180个测试题，并对33个先进模型进行评测。

Result: 评测显示模型表现差异大，存在与人类直觉不符的困难感知，二维到三维性能急剧下降，且模型倾向用公式推导代替空间可视化。

Conclusion: 当前先进多模态大语言模型在空间可视化任务上仍有显著不足，SpatialViz-Bench为该领域提供了重要的评估工具。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Conclusion: ViLU提供了一种有效且通用的不确定性量化解决方案，特别适用于视觉-语言模型的故障预测，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

Conclusion: 该工作开辟了基于几何运动建模的生成视频编码新方向，兼顾语义准确性和运动细节，有效提升超低码率视频重建质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Conclusion: MolCLIP有效融合了细胞视频与分子模态信息，显著提升了药物作用机制的识别性能，展示了时间动态特征与分子信息结合的潜力。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in

### [55] [Rationale-Enhanced Decoding for Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07685)
*Shin'ya Yamaguchi,Kosuke Nishida,Daiki Chijiwa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在多模态链式思维(CoT)推理中忽略生成推理内容的问题，提出了一种推理时解码策略——理由增强解码(RED)，显著提升了模型的推理准确性和合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在使用CoT提示时，往往忽视生成的推理理由内容，导致多模态推理的准确性和可靠性不足。

Method: 将多模态CoT推理重新表述为基于理由条件对数似然的KL约束奖励最大化问题，提出RED解码策略，通过乘积图像条件及理由条件的下一个词分布，实现视觉与推理理由信息的融合。

Result: 在多个基准测试和不同LVLM模型上，RED方法均显著优于标准CoT及其他解码方法，提高了多模态推理的准确率和推理内容的可信度。

Conclusion: RED为提升LVLM链式思维推理的准确性和合理性提供了一个高效实用的解码策略，推动了更可靠的基于理由的多模态系统发展。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去模糊方法在处理空间变化的局部运动模糊时计算资源分配低效且效果有限，亟需一种针对局部模糊区域的高效恢复策略。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了局部运动模糊去除性能，显著降低计算资源消耗，具有较强的实用和推广价值。

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

Conclusion: CRAFT方法有效提升了统一视觉语言模型在多任务指令下的对抗攻击转移能力，验证了跨任务对抗攻击的可行性和挑战。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于医疗图像数据敏感，公开数据集有限且被广泛使用，需验证现有AI方法是否依赖数据集偏见，从而确保模型专注于真实病理特征，而非捷径。

Method: 在NIH、CheXpert、MIMIC-CXR和PadChest等公开胸部X光数据集中，实施“Name that dataset”任务，采用多种神经网络架构，且通过简单数据转换增加任务难度，检测数据集间偏见。

Result: 通过不同网络架构和数据转换，验证了数据集之间存在偏见，表明模型可能利用数据集固有特征完成任务，而非真正病理信息。

Conclusion: 需要更多可解释的医疗影像研究及更多公开医疗数据集，促进模型专注于真实病理而非数据集捷径，提高医疗AI的可靠性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前基于SAM的2D图像分割模型难以直接应用于需要高计算资源的3D医学体积数据，如CT或MRI扫描，且现有3D方法依赖复杂的滑动窗口策略，导致推理时间长和实现复杂。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效简化了3D医学影像的提示分割流程，提升了效率并保持了高性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在减轻大型视觉语言模型中的对象幻觉时存在解码限制、复杂视觉输入修改或依赖外部模型知识等缺陷。

Method: 提出了一种能量基解码方法，通过动态选择具有最小能量分数的隐藏层状态，降低"是"答案比例的偏差。

Conclusion: 该能量基解码方法简单有效，显著减轻了视觉语言模型的偏见，提高了视觉问答任务的准确度和F1分数，具备较好推广价值。

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

Motivation: 为了满足人机交互中对早期活动识别的高响应性需求，传统基于帧或体素的方法因时间分辨率低而受限，而使用脉冲神经网络可以利用事件相机的高时间分辨率进行快速准确的预测。

Method: 设计了一个高频率双流脉冲神经网络，在大型THU EACT-50数据集上进行训练和测试，并在早期事件识别框架中逐步评估识别精度。

Conclusion: 高频率双流SNN有效提升了事件驱动的早期人体动作识别性能，适用于诸如运动捕捉等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

Motivation: 现有视频时序定位方法多依赖冻结的预训练特征，适应性差，全量微调成本高，且传统侧调方法忽视了时序定位的稀疏性。

Method: 设计了首个无锚侧调架构——SDST，结合参考变形自注意力机制增强上下文建模，并首次将InternVideo2骨干融入侧调框架。

Conclusion: 提出的SDST架构有效解决了参数高效微调中的稀疏性问题，兼顾性能和效率，推动视频时序定位技术发展。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了SCOOTER，一个用于评估无限制对抗攻击的开源框架，旨在通过人类评价验证对抗样本的真实性和不可察觉性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无限制的对抗攻击绕过了传统的基于范数的防御方法，但缺乏对对抗样本不可察觉性的统计显著评估，需要统一框架支持人类感知的评估。

Method: 提出SCOOTER框架，包括众包研究指南、大规模人类与模型对比实验、开源软件工具和包含数千图像与评分的基准数据集。

Result: 通过346名参与者的实验，发现多种颜色空间和基于扩散的攻击未能实现不可察觉，同时GPT-4o模型可初步检测一部分对抗样本。

Conclusion: 机器视觉系统与人类感知不一致，强调了基于人类评价的SCOOTER基准测试的重要性。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

*Mélanie Roschewitz,Raghav Mehta,Fabio de Sousa Ribeiro,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了图像分类中数据集迁移下的校准状态，比较了多种后处理和训练中校准方法，提出了实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界数据集迁移条件下，如何实现模型的稳健校准是实际应用中的关键挑战。

Method: 对八个不同图像分类任务进行广泛实验，比较后处理校准方法与训练中校准策略（如标签平滑）在多种自然迁移下的表现，并分析集成方法的影响。

Result: 发现熵正则和标签平滑结合效果最佳；利用少量语义外分布数据的后处理校准更稳健；新兴校准方法未必优于简单方法；提高迁移下校准往往牺牲分布内校准；基础模型微调比随机初始化表现更好；集成前校准优于后校准，且微调与集成结合效果最佳。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了多种校准策略在数据迁移条件下的优劣，为实际应用中实现稳健校准提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D卷积神经网络的端到端远程光电容积描记(rPPG)信号提取网络，有效提升了准确率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络模型在复杂场景下的准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力不足，难以从视频中准确提取心率信号。

Method: 引入差分帧融合模块结合原始帧捕捉血容量脉冲变化，融合带自注意力机制的时间偏移模块(TSM)，并设计动态混合损失函数，提升特征表达与防止过拟合。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG及复杂场景的MMPD数据集上进行多项实验，跨数据集测试中提出模型显著优于当前最先进模型，MAE达到7.58。

Conclusion: 该网络在复杂环境下表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，验证了设计方法的有效性与实用价值。

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

*Xi Xiao,Yunbei Zhang,Xingjian Li,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yuxiang Wei,Jihun Hamm,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT)的新方法，通过结合实例级和数据集级视觉提示，提升了视觉Transformer的微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉提示调优方法使用统一的数据集级提示，导致在下游任务中性能受限，因各样本间差异较大。

Method: ViaPT基于每个输入生成实例感知提示，并利用主成分分析(PCA)融合实例级与数据集级提示，兼顾两者优势，减少可训练参数。

Result: 在34个数据集上的广泛实验表明，ViaPT持续超过现有最先进方法，性能优异且参数量较少。

Conclusion: 通过结合实例级和数据集级提示，ViaPT解决了传统VPT中无法有效捕获实例信息的问题，为视觉Transformer的提示调优树立了新范式。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Synergistic Prompting（SyP）的新框架，针对视觉识别中的缺失模态问题，通过动态适配器和协同提示策略，实现了多模态的灵活自适应，显著提升了模型在缺失数据环境下的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多模态模型在现实应用中常因模态缺失而性能下降，传统静态提示方法缺乏灵活性且提示调优难以保证关键模态缺失时的性能。

Method: SyP框架引入动态适配器生成自适应缩放因子动态生成提示，替代静态参数，实现灵活多模态适配；并结合静态和动态提示形成协同提示策略，平衡模态信息，增强缺失模态下的推理能力。

Result: SyP在三个常用视觉识别数据集上显著优于现有方法，在不同缺失率和条件下表现出良好的鲁棒性。消融实验验证了该方法有效处理缺失模态，展示了更强的适应性和可靠性。

Conclusion: SyP框架通过灵活动态的提示机制和协同策略，有效解决了多模态缺失问题，实现了更稳定和高效的视觉识别，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Vision Transformers的无标记肺肿瘤运动预测方法，比较了患者特异性模型与多患者模型在临床约束下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺肿瘤运动的精准预测对质子治疗剂量递送至关重要，目前基于深度学习的无标记预测方法多未采用表现优异的Transformer架构。

Method: 使用31名患者的4DCT数据生成数字重建X线影像训练多患者模型，另用单一患者的计划数据训练患者特异性模型，均预测1秒内的肿瘤运动，比较两模型在计划及治疗数据上的表现。

Result: 患者特异性模型在计划数据上表现更优，尤其数据量大时显著优于多患者模型；多患者模型对解剖结构间变化更鲁棒，治疗数据上表现相当且无需重训练。

Conclusion: 首次将ViT应用于无标记肿瘤运动预测，患者特异性模型精度高，多患者模型稳健且适合临床短时应用。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有拼图求解方法多缺乏对真实世界中碎片缺失和损坏等挑战的考量，限制了实际应用，故研究其鲁棒性十分必要。

Method: 引入三种拼图腐蚀类型（缺失碎片、边缘侵蚀、内容侵蚀），评估启发式和深度学习求解器的表现，并利用数据增强对深度学习模型进行微调以提升鲁棒性。

Result: 标准拼图求解器性能随腐蚀程度迅速下降，但深度学习模型通过微调展现显著鲁棒性提升，其中Positional Diffusion模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 深度学习结合数据增强可大幅增强拼图求解器在真实世界复杂破损拼图场景中的表现，未来研究应聚焦鲁棒性和适应性提升。

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Conclusion: SimCIS利用特征对齐和创新的重放策略有效解决了连续图像分割中的可塑性和遗忘问题，展现出强大的性能优势。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM作为一个具有挑战性且接近真实工业环境的基准数据集，有助于推动强健的3D异常检测模型的发展，满足现代制造业的需求。

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Conclusion: MIRA有效解决了多模态大语言模型在医疗领域事实一致性的问题，通过智能检索与增强机制，实现了更可靠和准确的医疗辅助诊断。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

*Xiao Yang,Yuxuan Fan,Can Liu,Houcheng Su,Weichen Guo,Jiyao Wang,Dengbo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于专家知识的自监督测试时适应（Test-Time Adaptation, TTA）策略CiCi，用于远程光电容积描记法（rPPG）任务，实现模型在推理阶段的实时无源端适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的rPPG模型在不同环境中的适应性较差，且现有域适应和泛化方法受隐私和实时性的限制，难以应用于实际部署。

Method: 基于生理学先验知识，利用rPPG信号频域中的时空一致性和时域中的不一致性，引入了一种专家知识驱动的自监督一致性-不一致性集成（CiCi）框架，同时设计梯度动态控制机制以缓解先验间的冲突，提升模型推理阶段的适应能力。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上，采用TTA协议的实验表明该方法在无访问源数据的情况下，实现了实时自监督适应，性能持续优于现有技术，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提出的基于专家知识的CiCi框架为rPPG模型提供了一种有效的实时自适应方案，有望解决实际部署中隐私保护和模型泛用性的挑战。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Conclusion: 所提出的追踪和识别系统能够实现连续自动化的实验小鼠个体监测，为动态疾病进展和治疗效果评估提供了高效、精确的技术支持，同时改善了动物福利监控。

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

demands inference models that harmonize accuracy with computational efficiency.
This paper introduces TinierHAR, an ultra-lightweight deep learning
architecture that synergizes residual depthwise separable convolutions, gated
recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal aggregation to achieve SOTA efficiency
without compromising performance. Evaluated across 14 public HAR datasets,

systematic ablation study dissecting the contributions of spatial-temporal
components across proposed TinierHAR, prior SOTA TinyHAR, and the classical
DeepConvLSTM, offering actionable insights for designing efficient HAR systems.
We finally discussed the findings and suggested principled design guidelines
for future efficient HAR. To catalyze edge-HAR research, we open-source all

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型仅基于二维视频数据训练，难以有效捕捉和表达动态三维世界的几何结构。

Method: 引入Geometry Forcing方法，通过两个对齐目标（角度对齐和尺度对齐）使模型中间表示与预训练的几何基础模型特征保持一致，从而内化三维几何信息。

Result: 该方法在多个视频生成任务中显著提升了视频的视觉质量和三维一致性，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入几何引导，视频扩散模型能够更好地理解和利用三维几何结构，增强生成视频的质量和物理一致性。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了OST-Bench，一个用于评估多模态大语言模型在线时空理解能力的新基准，反映了实际场景中动态空间推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在固定离线环境下表现良好，但缺乏对动态在线场景中时空推理能力的测试，无法反映真实世界中的主动探索和记忆整合需求。

Method: 设计并构建OST-Bench基准，包含来自ScanNet、Matterport3D和ARKitScenes的1400个场景和10000个问答对，模拟机器人主动探索环境时，模型需基于增量获取的视觉信息和历史记忆进行时空推理。

Result: 多款现有领先模型在OST-Bench测试中表现较差，随着探索时间和记忆容量增加，准确率下降明显，特别是在复杂线索推理和长期记忆检索任务中表现不足。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在线时空推理能力有限，需针对复杂空间线索推理和长期记忆检索进行改进，本基准为相关领域研究提供了有价值的测试和开发平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型在视觉-语言绑定任务中的局限性，发现数据属性对其性能影响显著，而单纯调整训练策略效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在理解图像中对象属性组合方面存在缺陷，且现有方法未能彻底解决这一绑定问题。

Method: 通过合成数据集严谨分析自然数据中的属性密度、描述完整性及显著性偏差对CLIP绑定能力的影响。

Result: 揭示了低属性密度、不完整描述和显著性偏差削弱了CLIP的绑定效果，增加硬负样本无助于提升性能。

Conclusion: 数据本身的属性是提升CLIP绑定能力的关键，改进数据表达可显著增强模型性能。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为STTM的无训练时空令牌合并方法，通过利用视频数据的局部时空冗余，实现计算加速同时保持较高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型因时空令牌数量多，计算量呈二次方增长，需减少令牌以提升效率。

Method: STTM首先利用四叉树结构进行多粒度空间令牌生成，然后在时间维度上有向成对合并令牌，减少计算复杂度且无需训练。

Result: 在六个视频问答基准测试中，STTM在50%令牌预算下实现2倍加速，准确率仅下降0.5%；在30%预算下加速达3倍，准确率下降2%。

Conclusion: STTM有效利用局部时空冗余，无需训练即可显著减少计算量并保持性能，且支持不同问题间缓存复用，提升视频问答模型效率。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Method: 提出统一的多层次评价框架BASIC，包括结构保真度、推理对齐性和语境连贯性。结构层面采用分割掩码指标，语义层面利用多模态大语言模型提取场景表示，并进行详细、可扩展的比较。

Result: 在多个视觉解码方法和多套神经成像数据集上进行了基准测试，展示该框架具备更有区分力、解释性强和全面的评估能力。

Conclusion: BASIC框架为大脑视觉解码方法的评估提供了更加科学、细粒度和多维度的标准，有助于推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

Motivation: 现有视觉表示学习方法普遍采用固定长度表示，忽视了输入数据复杂性和熟悉度的差异，且现有自适应分词方法多需多次编码搜索，计算开销大，因此希望设计一种高效的单遍预测token数量的适应性分词方法。

Method: 提出了单遍自适应分词器KARL，基于Kolmogorov复杂度思想，在一次前向传播中预测token数，通过训练使模型条件预测token停止位置，类似倒置强化学习机制。

Result: KARL在单遍操作下达到与现有多遍适应性分词器相媲美的性能，同时展示了编码器/解码器规模及编码方式对效果的影响，并验证了预测的图像复杂度与人类直觉一致。

Conclusion: KARL有效结合算法信息理论与视觉表征学习，实现了更高效的适应性图像分词，有助于理解图像复杂性的计算表征及其应用潜力。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension

Method: 利用点互信息（PMI）测量词对共现频率，使用合成与编辑的自然图像对应不同PMI值，分析CLIP及其衍生模型的零样本准确率与PMI的相关性。

Conclusion: 多模态模型的组合泛化受限于训练数据中概念的共现组合，未来需设计新的算法和架构以无须指数级数据增长提升组合泛化能力。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两步因果实验方法，研究大语言模型认知偏差的来源，发现偏差主要源自预训练而非微调随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前研究发现大语言模型存在认知偏差且随微调不同而变化，但不清楚偏差差异是源自预训练、微调还是训练随机性的影响。

Method: 通过多次不同随机种子微调模型，分析训练随机性对30余种认知偏差的影响；引入交叉微调方法，交换指令数据集以隔离偏差来源，验证偏差是否依赖于数据集。

Result: 训练随机性带来一定偏差差异，但偏差主要由预训练模型决定，拥有相同预训练骨干的模型偏差模式更相似，而仅共享微调数据集的模型偏差差异更大。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型偏差需关注预训练阶段的影响，未来应结合预训练和微调因素设计有效的偏差评估与缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型(LLMs)在规范性社会科学调查中的响应稳健性，发现所有模型普遍存在对最后呈现选项的记忆偏见，并对语义变体敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs被用作社会科学调查中的人类代理，但其响应的可靠性及对已知偏见的敏感度尚未充分了解。

Method: 选取9种不同LLMs，对世界价值观调查(WVS)中的问题进行了11种提问和答案结构扰动，模拟约167,000次访谈以测试模型的响应稳健性。

Result: 发现所有模型都存在明显的记忆偏见（偏好最后一个答案），大型模型一般更稳健，但对语义变体和联合扰动依然敏感。LLMs在某种程度上与人类调查响应偏见相符。

Conclusion: 在使用LLMs生成合成调查数据时，应重视提示设计和稳健性测试，以避免模型对问题或答案改动的过度敏感和潜在偏见的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

TL;DR: SynthTextEval是一个综合评估合成文本的工具包，涵盖实用性、公平性、隐私风险等多个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型输出文本流畅度提升，合成文本在隐私保护等高风险领域有潜力应用，但需要统一且全面的评估方法确保其有效性和安全性。

Method: SynthTextEval提供多维度评估框架，用户可上传或生成合成文本进行实用性、公平性、隐私泄漏风险、分布差异及专家定性反馈的评估。

Result: 该工具包在医疗和法律两个高风险领域的数据集上展示了其功能和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化和整合评估指标，SynthTextEval提升了合成文本的应用可行性，促进了AI开发中的隐私保护。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗领域中大型语言模型的应用日益广泛，模型输出直接影响健康安全，现有安全评估多集中于通用基准，缺乏针对医疗特定角色的细分安全评测。

Method: 设计了包含患者和临床医生视角的安全评估协议，构建PatientSafetyBench数据集，针对5个关键类别收集样本，并在MediPhi模型上进行红队测试。

Result: 首次定义了从患者、临床医生和一般用户三个视角的安全评估标准，并通过具体数据集和实验展示了医疗LLMs在安全方面的表现和潜在风险。

Conclusion: 本文为医疗LLMs的安全部署建立了多维度安全评估基础，推动了医疗领域语言模型更安全更可靠的应用。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在协作学习课堂中，多个小组的对话往往同时进行，语音重叠普遍存在，现有的中断检测多基于单一对话环境且语音较为清晰，难以适应实际课堂多重对话的复杂场景。

Method: 分析了单一对话和多组对话环境中的中断检测，开发了一种对重叠语音具有鲁棒性的中断识别方法，同时研究了中断在协作中的语言和韵律特征。

Result: 该方法能够有效识别存在重叠语音的中断现象，为课堂中AI支持的协作学习交互监控提供了技术基础。

Conclusion: 提出的中断检测方法增强了教学环境中AI代理对复杂对话的理解能力，为未来研究解决多组对话重叠语音影响奠定了基础。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

Conclusion: 多智能体检索增强框架有效提升了健康错误信息反驳言论的质量和准确性，且每个组件对整体效果均有积极贡献。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长文本时计算复杂度为平方级，效率低下，需要一种高效且准确的模型架构。

Method: 结合GNN和CNN，实时端到端图生成，利用大语言模型的词嵌入和情感极性信息，通过字级输入处理，无需填充截断，使用基于晶格结构和小世界图的图模型捕获局部和文档级信息。

Result: 生成的图具有良好语义结构特性（平均聚类系数约0.45，平均最短路径4到5），模型在情感分析和新闻分类任务中表现出高效且竞争力强的性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在长文本分类任务中提高了效率和性能，展示了结合GNN和CNN处理长文本的有效性和可行性。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域中生成式AI在辅助临床决策和患者交流方面潜力巨大，但一个关键挑战是如何实现有效的人机交流，确保内容既个性化又易于理解。

Method: 提出MedReadCtrl框架，通过指令微调使大语言模型（LLMs）能够控制输出的复杂度，同时保持信息的完整性。

Result: 在医疗和通用领域的九个数据集和三个任务上，MedReadCtrl显示出比GPT-4更低的可读性指令遵循错误率，并在未见过的临床任务中显著提升性能（如ROUGE-L提升14.7，SARI提升6.18）。专家评审更倾向于MedReadCtrl的输出（71.7% vs 23.3%），尤其在低识字水平患者中表现突出。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl能够将临床内容重构为更易理解的语言，同时保持医疗信息的准确性，为促进患者教育和公平访问AI医疗资源提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

Motivation: 现有方法通常效仿专家行为或优化偏好，但缺乏对备选动作的推理和比较，导致模型可能过度依赖看似合理但次优的动作。

Method: 引入自洽动作采样和执行引导的动作批评机制，实现基于模型自身生成的逐步动作推敲过程，并利用这些推敲轨迹迭代微调模型。

Conclusion: SAND框架有效增强了LLM代理在动作选择上的理性推敲能力，显著提升任务表现，展示了动作深思熟虑对于代理调优的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

Motivation: 强化学习在大语言模型中训练过程能量消耗大且不稳定，且策略可能偏离预训练权重。

Conclusion: RLEP通过经验回放有效引导模型避免无效探索，提升学习效果，为大语言模型强化学习训练提供了高效且稳定的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

Motivation: 现有研究关注LLM幻觉和谄媚现象，但缺乏覆盖更广泛失真行为的统一理论框架，作者希望通过机器胡扯框架揭示LLM失真背后的机制。

Method: 提出“胡扯指数”量化模型对真相的漠视，设计四种定性胡扯分类（空洞修辞、虚假言辞、模棱两可辞汇、未经验证的声明），并基于多个数据集进行大规模实证评估。

Result: 实验发现，人类反馈强化学习显著加剧胡扯现象，推理链提示放大特定胡扯形式（空洞修辞和虚假言辞），政治语境中模棱两可辞汇最为普遍。

Conclusion: 机器胡扯现象揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战，研究为促进更真实的LLM行为提供了新视角和方法。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

Motivation: 当前利用任务分解提升大模型性能效果显著，但针对小型开源LLM的后训练利用尚未充分研究。

Method: 设计统一的后训练框架PLAN-TUNING，先从大模型蒸馏合成任务分解路径，再用监督和强化学习目标微调小模型，模仿规划过程。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH数据集上提升约7%，在跨领域OlympiadBench和AIME 2024上分别提升约10%和12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING通过模拟规划路径有效提升小型LLM的复杂推理能力，是提升其任务特定性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Motivation: 现有代码执行模拟方法因依赖复杂算法结构导致模型过拟合算法模式，难以提升核心推理能力。

Method: 提出TeaR方法，通过精心的数据筛选和强化学习引导模型发现最优推理路径，提升代码相关任务的推理表现。

Result: 在多种模型（1.5B至32B参数）和17个包含数学、知识、代码、逻辑推理的基准测试中，TeaR均显著提升性能，Qwen2.5-7B提升35.9%，R1-Distilled-7B提升5.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR有效促进LLM更优推理路径的学习，增强了模型的通用推理能力，推动LLM推理能力提升方向发展。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Motivation: 由于科学文献内容复杂且多样，从大量文献中结构化提取ORR催化剂信息具有挑战性。

Method: 构建包含12类实体和2类实体关系的燃料电池材料语料库，采用手动标注结合基于Transformer的DyGIE++模型，使用MatSciBERT和PubMedBERT等多种领域特定预训练模型进行微调以提升信息抽取效果。

Result: 微调后的PubMedBERT模型在命名实体识别任务中达到82.19%的F1分数，MatSciBERT模型在关系抽取任务中达到66.10%的F1分数，且模型表现优于一般的科学领域模型如BlueBERT。

Conclusion: 基于领域特定预训练模型的自动信息抽取方法在提取ORR催化剂相关信息上表现稳定且高效，有助于实现文献的大规模自动分析，推动材料信息学的发展。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的语言模型广泛应用，了解LLMs在复杂任务和自主代理应用中的性能极限变得尤为重要。

Method: 通过分析LLMs推理的计算复杂性，证明了LLMs在处理超出某一复杂度的计算和代理任务时存在固有限制，并且无法验证复杂任务的准确性。

Result: 展示了LLMs无法执行或验证超出特定复杂度的任务的具体例子，揭示其固有的能力边界。

Conclusion: LLMs在执行复杂计算和代理任务时受限于计算复杂性，且在验证复杂任务准确性方面存在缺陷，这对其在现实世界应用中的使用提出了警示。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Motivation: 应对不断增长的心理支持需求，弥补非英语语境下相关数据集稀缺的问题。

Method: 通过微调对话生成器生成大规模心理咨询对话，并用对话修改器调整对话质量，结合自动和人工方法构建数据集CPsDD；同时开发包含用户分析、对话总结、策略规划和同理心回复生成模块的支持系统CADSS。

Result: 构建了包含68K对话的CPsDD数据集，并在CPsDD及ESConv数据集上，CADSS在策略预测和情感支持对话任务中表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合有限真实数据与专家知识，成功构建高质量中文心理支持对话数据集和支持系统，推动了心理支持对话技术的发展。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Motivation: 现有关于轮流发言的研究大多集中在两人对话中，缺乏对三人对话环境下的研究。

Method: 利用声学数据训练多种模型，在日语三人对话数据集上进行声音活动预测。

Result: 基于三人对话训练的VAP模型在所有模型中表现优于基线，且不同话题对准确度有影响。

Conclusion: VAP方法可有效用于三人对话的轮流发言预测，未来计划将其整合到语音对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Motivation: 探讨在存在噪声或低质量数据环境下，如何利用LLMs通过少量示例提示达到或超越微调的小型语言模型的效果。

Method: 采用先进的提示工程技术，包括辩论式LLMs和示例选择策略，但最终发现精心设计的标准少量示例提示效果最佳。

Result: 系统在CheckThat! 2025主观性检测任务中多语言排名靠前，阿拉伯语和波兰语夺冠，意大利语、英语、德语和多语言任务均进入前四。

Conclusion: 基于LLMs的少量示例学习在多语言情感分析中表现出强大的适应性和鲁棒性，是标签数据稀缺或不一致时微调的有力替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Motivation: 现有跨语言RAG研究多集中于生成任务及开放域数据，难以反映实际语言检索挑战，尤其在领域特定场景中的表现缺乏系统分析。

Method: 构建真实企业数据集，随机组合用户查询语言与支持文档语言，系统研究多语言检索行为；提出一种均衡两语言检索的简单策略来提升跨语言检索能力。

Result: 发现跨语言查询与文档检索时性能显著下降，主要因检索器难以跨语言排序文档。新策略显著改善了跨语言及整体检索性能。

Conclusion: 跨语言领域特定检索是RAG性能瓶颈，均衡语言检索策略有效缓解该瓶颈，为实际多语言RAG应用提供改进方向。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了大规模视觉语言模型中长链思维监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的作用及其交互，发现两者单独有效但难以协同提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然在纯语言模型中协同提升推理能力，但在视觉语言模型中表现未明，需深入理解两种技术的不同贡献及其结合效果。

Method: 通过多个多模态推理基准测试，系统评估长链思维SFT和RL在不同难度问题上的表现与交互，尝试多种结合训练策略及数据与模型融合。

Result: SFT提升复杂问题的深入推理能力但导致简单问题表现下降和冗长回答；RL促进泛化和简洁回答，整体提升稳定但对难题帮助有限。多种结合策略未能产生叠加效应，反而导致准确率、推理风格与回答长度的权衡。

Conclusion: 指出了视觉语言模型中使用长链思维SFT与RL方法的“协同困境”，强调未来需要更自适应且无缝的训练策略以充分发挥两者结合的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Motivation: 文档图像机器翻译面临训练数据有限和视觉与文本信息复杂交互导致的泛化挑战。

Method: M4Doc框架通过对齐图像编码器与预训练的多模态大型语言模型的多模态表示，使轻量级模型在训练中学习视觉文本关联，推理时不依赖大型模型以保证效率。

Result: 实验表明，M4Doc在翻译质量上有显著提升，特别是跨领域和复杂文档图像场景中表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的M4Doc有效提升了DIMT的泛化能力和效率，是解决视觉文本结合难题的有效方案。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Motivation: 揭示离散扩散语言模型中的隐藏贝叶斯核心，提升模型推理时的概率估计准确度和不确定性度量。

Method: 通过利用正向掩码分布下去噪器输出的期望来恢复清洁标记的精确后验概率，使用K次独立腐坏的蒙特卡罗边缘化近似后验，并设计推理时的集成方法平均多次mask and denoise结果。

Result: 在WikiText-2数据集上，利用K=8次集成方法，模型实现了测试困惑度8.8，显著优于同规模GPT-2 Small模型的20.3。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在不增加训练成本的情况下，通过贝叶斯视角的多次掩码与去噪集成提升了语言模型的性能和不确定性估计能力。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽效果卓越，但计算资源需求大，限制了其在资源受限环境中的应用。

Method: 通过知识蒸馏对Pythia和Qwen2.5模型进行压缩，并在SQuAD和MLQA两个问答基准数据集上进行零样本和单样本提示测试。

Result: 蒸馏后的学生模型在参数减少最多57.1%的同时，保留了超过90%的教师模型性能，且单样本提示比零样本提示效果更优。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合少量提示技术能在保证性能的前提下显著压缩大型语言模型，使其适用于资源受限环境中的问答系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注提升准确度和召回率，而忽视了查询检索次数的效率问题，导致推理过程效率低下。

Method: 提出利用改进提示的标准ReAct流程提升性能，且通过少量监督和基于强化学习的微调减少推理时的检索次数，提高效率。

Result: 改进后的ReAct方法在HotPotQA等基准上表现优于最新技术，同时通过少量训练样本达到接近一半检索次数的延迟成本，保持竞争力的RAG指标。

Conclusion: 大规模微调并非提升RAG性能的必要条件，合理的提示设计和少量训练结合可有效提升性能和推理效率，为复杂问题回答提供更节约的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Motivation: 当前针对中文毒性内容的检测受到利用同音或近同音变体隐藏恶意意图的语言现象PCR的挑战，现有评测多基于规则合成扰动，忽视了用户真实创造力，缺乏真实语言场景的评测基准。

Method: 将PCR按表面形式组织成四类，收集自然出现的500条带有语音隐蔽的攻击帖子，建立真实数据集；使用多种先进大语言模型进行基准测试并分析错误；基于分析结果采用基于拼音的提示策略以恢复检测准确率。

Result: 最佳大语言模型在数据集上仅取得0.672的F1分数，零样本链式思考提示反而降低性能；拼音提示策略显著提高了检测准确率。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统地分类了中文PCR现象，暴露了当前检测模型的局限，提出了一个现实的检测基准和一种有效轻量的拼音提示缓解方法，对稳健毒性检测研究有推动作用。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Motivation: 现有摘要质量评估依赖人工参考摘要，成本高，缺乏自动且有效的评估指标。

Method: 引入NOIR指标，基于语言模型嵌入计算摘要与原文的语义相似度，同时结合摘要长度，实现自动化质量评估。

Result: 实验表明NOIR有效捕捉了摘要的长度与语义保持权衡，且与人类对摘要质量的感知高度相关。

Conclusion: NOIR为多种摘要任务提供了一种无需人工参考的自动化评估工具，有助于提升摘要算法及生成摘要质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Conclusion: SAS能够在保持模型紧凑的同时提升注意力容量和表达能力，为Transformer架构的改进提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型微调消耗资源巨大，且随着模型规模增长，成本和时间问题愈发突出，传统RAG方法在可扩展性和答题准确性上存在明显局限。

Method: K2RAG采用分治策略，集成密集与稀疏向量检索、知识图谱及训练数据摘要预处理步骤，显著提升检索质量及训练效率。

Result: 在MultiHopRAG数据集上，K2RAG的答案相似度得分优于典型RAG实现，训练时间减少93%，推理速度提升40%，显存需求减少三倍。

Conclusion: K2RAG有效解决了传统RAG的扩展性和效率问题，为大规模知识扩展提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

TL;DR: 本文复现并扩展了Vec2Text框架，验证了从文本嵌入中重构原文的可行性，并探索了防护措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vec2Text提出了通过控制解码从黑盒文本嵌入中重构原文的强大能力，挑战了嵌入隐私性的传统假设，激发了进一步验证与研究的需求。

Method: 复现Vec2Text，在域内外设置中验证其结果，分析参数敏感性，测试重构敏感输入的可行性，并探讨嵌入量化作为轻量级隐私保护方法。

Result: 成功复制了主要实验结果，确认了Vec2Text在理想条件下能够重构密码类无明显语义的序列。发现其对输入长度敏感，并且通过加入高斯噪声和嵌入量化能有效缓解隐私风险。

Conclusion: 强调了使用文本嵌入时需谨慎，呼吁进一步研究稳健的NLP系统隐私防护机制。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

Method: 利用当前策略与参考模型之间的Token级别对数概率差异，选择性地专注于高影响Token进行优化。

Result: 选择性DPO方法在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试上优于标准DPO和蒸馏基线，且高质量参考模型能显著提升效果。

Conclusion: Token级别优化与参考模型选择对提升大语言模型偏好对齐具有重要意义。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Motivation: 现有的流式语音翻译方法依赖于句子级语音分割，限制了模型在有限上下文中的策略决策和翻译质量，且模型难以学习有效策略。

Method: 提出StreamUni，利用统一的大型语音-语言模型和语音链式思维引导多阶段输出，联合完成语音分割、策略决策和翻译生成，同时采用流式CoT训练提升低延迟策略决策能力。

Result: 实验表明，StreamUni在流式语音翻译任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni有效解决了流式语音翻译中策略决策和上下文限制的问题，实现了无需大量策略训练的高效流式翻译。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的解码模型，能够将信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入向量反转为具体的逻辑公式，实现嵌入到公式的可逆映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现连续语义空间中对逻辑公式的学习和优化，需要将语义嵌入准确且可逆地转化为具体的逻辑公式。

Method: 利用Transformer解码器，训练模型根据STL公式的语义嵌入生成对应的逻辑公式。通过构造STL小词汇表来指导训练。

Result: 模型在仅训练1个epoch后即可生成有效公式，10个epoch后能够准确捕捉逻辑语义，且生成的公式更简洁语义等价。

Conclusion: 方法有效地实现了STL语义嵌入到逻辑公式的反向转换，支持跨分布泛化，并能用于需求挖掘任务中在语义空间的直接优化。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Conclusion: 标准指令调优损失存在次优问题，应重新审视损失函数设计，WIT提供了提升模型鲁棒性和泛化能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Method: 方法是在固定的源语言分词器基础上，学习一个条件化的目标语言分词器，以最大化跨语言语义对齐。

Result: 方法在四种语言对上的机器翻译和语言建模任务中测试，机器翻译性能无显著提升，但语言模型困惑度显著降低。

Conclusion: 条件单字元标记化存在数据效率瓶颈，需寻找替代参数化方法以实现实用的跨语言标记化。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Conclusion: 解决实体共指复杂性是提升RAG系统检索与生成效果的关键，研究结果为知识密集型AI应用中的优化提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

Motivation: 现有的对话健康代理缺乏多轮适应性推理、症状澄清和透明决策，限制了其在临床诊断中的实际应用。

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分为症状引出、病史获取和因果图构建三个模块，每个模块基于可信度评分引导自适应提问和信息澄清，优化推理过程。

Result: 在两个中文真实问诊数据集上，DocCHA比领先的大型语言模型基线提高最多5.18%的诊断准确率，症状回忆率提升超过30%，增加的对话轮次有限。

Conclusion: DocCHA有效实现了结构化、透明且高效的诊断对话，为多语言及资源受限环境中的可信LLM临床助手提供了可能。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant
challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic
modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that
lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We
introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end
system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal
insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing,
multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at
https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/DTECT.

### [138] [SAGE: A Visual Language Model for Anomaly Detection via Fact Enhancement and Entropy-aware Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07939)
*Guoxin Zang,Xue Li,Donglin Di,Lanshun Nie,Dechen Zhan,Yang Song,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对工业异常检测中视觉语言模型（VLMs）在解释性和泛化能力上的不足，提出了基于VLM的SAGE框架，通过自引导事实增强和熵感知优化提升异常推理能力，并构建了偏好优化的数据集和多尺度逻辑评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在工业异常检测中难以提供可解释的推理和泛化到未见类别，主要因异常检测具有强领域特定性，需要精确且结构化的上下文分析。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，利用自引导事实增强(SFE)将领域知识融入视觉推理，采用熵感知直接偏好优化(E-DPO)使模型输出符合专家偏好；构建包含特定专家排序答案的工业异常推理数据集AD-PL，并设计多尺度逻辑评估(MLE)框架量化模型逻辑和一致性。

Result: SAGE在零样本和少样本设置下，工业异常数据集上表现优越，体现了结构化事实增强和偏好优化的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识与专家偏好优化的VLM框架SAGE显著提升了工业异常推理的性能和可解释性，为工业异常检测提供了新型有效方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

*Yu Wang,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRIX是一种模块化多智能体记忆系统，突破传统记忆限制，支持多模态数据存储与检索，显著提升AI模型的长期记忆能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI记忆解决方案受限于平面且范围狭窄的记忆组件，难以实现个性化、抽象化和可靠的长期用户信息回忆。

Method: 设计了包含六种记忆类型（核心、情节、语义、程序、资源、知识库）和多智能体框架的MIRIX系统，实现动态更新和检索多样化长期用户数据。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA基准测试中，MIRIX准确率提升35%，存储需求减少99.9%；在长文本对话基准LOCOMO中，表现达到85.4%，领先现有方法。

Conclusion: MIRIX显著提升了多模态和单模态记忆能力，构建了面向长期用户数据管理的新标准，同时提供可视化、安全的用户应用。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [140] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）在泛化能力上的差异，发现IM-RM更依赖表面词汇线索，导致泛化能力较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然IM-RM和EX-RM在训练数据、损失函数和语言模型上几乎相同，但IM-RM在泛化能力，尤其是分布外表现上较弱，研究此差异的根本原因。

Method: 通过理论与实验分析，研究IM-RM和EX-RM在泛化行为上的差异，考察IM-RM对表面词汇线索的依赖及其对泛化能力的影响，同时排除其他假设。

Result: 发现IM-RM依赖表面词汇线索，因此在词汇分布变化时泛化能力较差。实验结果验证了这一点，并反驳了IM-RM因生成任务难度导致泛化差的直觉说法。

Conclusion: 文章强调即使是看似微小的设计选择也能显著影响奖励模型的泛化性能，提示设计时需慎重考虑奖励计算方式。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用语言模型支持风湿病学的临床决策，同时考虑资源限制和模型性能。

Method: 将较小的语言模型与检索增强生成（RAG）技术相结合，评估其在诊断和治疗任务中的表现。

Result: 较小模型结合RAG技术，诊断和治疗表现优于大型模型，且能耗更低，适合本地部署。

Conclusion: 较小模型加RAG技术是资源有限医疗环境的有力工具，但仍需专家监督以保证准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MedThink-Bench，一个用于评估大语言模型医疗推理能力的严谨且可扩展的基准。通过专家注释的分步推理和新颖的LLM-w-Ref评估框架，实现对中间推理过程的高保真评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在临床决策中应用日益广泛，迫切需要一个透明、可解释且可信的医疗推理能力评估工具，以弥补现有评估方法不足和缺乏严谨基准的问题。

Method: 构建包含500个跨10个医学领域挑战性问题及专家编写分步推理的MedThink-Bench基准，提出利用细粒度推理和LLM作为评审机制的LLM-w-Ref框架来评估模型中间推理过程。

Result: 实验证明LLM-w-Ref与专家判断高度相关，12个最先进的大语言模型的测试显示较小模型MedGemma-27B在医疗推理能力上能够超越部分大型专有模型如OpenAI-o3。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为评估大语言模型医疗推理提供了基础工具，有助于推动其在临床实践中的安全负责应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PyVision 是一个多轮交互框架，使多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）能够自主生成、执行和优化基于Python的工具，用于视觉推理任务，实现了灵活且可解释的问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法受限于预定义的工作流程和静态工具集，缺乏灵活性和动态适应能力。

Method: 提出PyVision框架，支持MLLMs动态生成并使用定制的Python工具，逐步执行和改进工具以完成视觉推理任务，并分析创建工具的分类及其应用效果。

Result: PyVision在多个基准测试中表现出显著性能提升，提升了GPT-4.1在V*数据集上的表现7.8%，以及Claude-4.0-Sonnet在VLMsAreBlind-mini上的31.1%。

Conclusion: 动态工具生成不仅使模型能使用工具，还能自主发明工具，推动视觉推理向更具主动性和灵活性的方向发展。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 最新大型语言模型在简单推理任务上表现不佳，易犯中间步骤错误，且对无关分布泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究为何最先进的大型语言模型在对人类来说简单的推理任务上频繁失败。

Method: 设计了一套程序生成的简单推理任务和一个包含简化版数学逻辑谜题的测评数据集，测试模型在不同参数和描述下的表现。

Result: 发现即使最先进的"思考型"模型也在这些简单任务上经常出错，表现出统计学捷径依赖、中间步骤错误和长上下文处理困难等问题。模型在简化谜题上表现不佳，显示出对原始问题的记忆导致泛化失败。

Conclusion: 前沿语言模型在处理简单推理任务的分布外泛化能力仍存在严重瓶颈，使任务更简单并不一定带来性能提升。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于不可训练、确定性输入嵌入的新型模型构建方法，通过固定的Unicode字形嵌入作为通用接口，实现模型模块的无缝组合及逐层构建，提升模型性能并节约资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型训练资源消耗大且缺乏灵活性，迫切需要一种更高效灵活的模型扩展方法。

Method: 利用冻结的视觉结构输入嵌入作为通用基底，通过输出端的简单平均实现不同领域专家模型的融合（Mixture-of-Experts），并采用逐层递进式训练策略逐步构建深层Transformer。

Result: 融合后的混合专家模型在多项推理任务（如MMLU）中表现优于单一专家模型，并且逐层增长的模型表现出深度与复杂推理能力的正相关。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了从整体训练转向模块构建的范式变革，促进资源高效扩展、持续学习与模块自由组合，推动AI系统的民主化发展。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Result: FashionBLIP-2结合FACap预训练后，在Fashion IQ和enhFashionIQ数据集上性能显著提升，尤其是在细粒度修改文本的图像检索任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文构建的FACap数据集和提出的FashionBLIP-2模型有效解决了时尚领域复合图像检索面临的细粒度理解和数据匮乏问题，为电商等应用场景提供强有力支持。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化评估工具autoeval-dmun，利用视觉语言模型评估扩散模型中信息去除的效果及其副作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器去学习虽可减少重新训练成本，但难以验证信息是否完全移除，且可能损害模型对相关概念的性能，影响部署。

Method: 设计autoeval-dmun，通过语言模型提取结构化世界知识，识别去学习过程中受损的相关概念，并使用敌对提示绕过去学习。

Result: 用autoeval-dmun评估现有去学习方法，发现语言模型能够建立概念语义排序，与去学习损害高度相关，且可用合成敌对提示有效绕过去学习。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun为扩散模型去学习提供了客观、高效的自动化评估手段，有助于验证去学习效果及减小对周边概念的负面影响。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合节点编码和最短路径序列建模的链路预测新框架SP4LP，能有效捕捉多跳结构信息，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法难以捕捉链路特有的结构模式，且注入结构信息的方式要么计算成本高，要么依赖简单启发式，无法建模多跳依赖。

Method: SP4LP先用GNN计算节点表示，再提取候选节点对的最短路径序列，利用序列模型处理路径节点嵌入，实现多跳关系模式建模。

Result: SP4LP在链路预测基准测试中表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SP4LP比传统消息传递型GNN和多种结构特征方法更具表现力，提供了一种高效且通用的链路预测方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Method: 提出了一个简单有效的稀疏适配器训练方法，并对多达20个自然语言处理任务的适配器进行合并实验，研究其合并特性。

Conclusion: 稀疏适配器作为模块化架构的构建基石相比传统LoRA表现更加优越，是参数高效任务专家合并的有力方案，但如何提升泛化仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为卷积码量化（CCQ）的推理优化方法，实现了大型语言模型（LLM）在2.0-2.75比特下的高效压缩，且几乎不损失准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM快速扩展导致推理成本大幅提升，传统8比特或4比特量化虽有效但仍存在部署困难，且低于3比特的量化会严重影响准确率和效率。

Method: CCQ方法结合硬件感知的位移编码与解码技术，卷积码，混合编码和码簇，构建无查表编码空间，实现码本与权重向量线性映射，提升推理性能，同时借鉴向量量化的数据映射策略，降低极低比特下的性能下降。

Result: 在多个基准测试上，CCQ在压缩大规模模型如DeepSeek-V3和ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B时表现卓越，实现单GPU部署并减少跨卡通信。

Conclusion: CCQ成功解决了低比特量化中的准确率和效率瓶颈，提供了大规模LLM实用的极低比特压缩方案，相关模型和推理引擎已开源。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）和注意力增强的输入分类方法G-Guard，用于防御针对大语言模型的多轮越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各类应用中的普及，其安全性问题尤为突出，尤其是多轮越狱攻击更难检测和防御。

Method: G-Guard构建实体图捕捉多轮对话中有害关键词与查询的关系，并引入注意力机制增强，利用最相似的单轮查询作为带标签节点辅助分类。

Result: 在所有数据集和评估指标上，G-Guard均优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard有效提升了对多轮越狱攻击的检测能力，提升了大语言模型的安全防护水平。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有利用大型语言模型生成文本描述的提示方法存在较高的变异性和可靠性低的问题，需要一种更稳定且语义更丰富的提示学习方法。

Method: 提出DeMul方法，省略文本描述生成步骤，直接将LLM知识蒸馏成连续向量表示的多提示，通过提示权重反映不同提示的重要性以优化训练。

Result: 在11个识别数据集上验证，DeMul方法表现优越，提示权重机制提升了模型的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: DeMul有效提升了视觉语言模型的提示学习能力，无需依赖文本描述，增强了模型在多样化数据上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为条件引导流匹配(CGFM)的新方法，用于改进时间序列预测，克服了扩散模型的限制，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中存在源分布僵化和采样路径有限的问题；流匹配方法虽然灵活且生成速度快，但未能充分利用辅助模型的预测误差信息，这些信息对提升性能至关重要。

Method: CGFM通过结合辅助模型输出，扩展了流匹配，允许从辅助模型误差中学习；结合历史数据作为条件和引导，构建双向条件概率路径，并利用广义仿射路径扩展概率路径空间。

Result: 大量实验表明，CGFM在时间序列预测任务中持续提升性能，并优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: CGFM有效释放了流匹配的潜力，改善了时间序列预测，推动了预测方法的发展。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

Conclusion: WSA有效地整合了多个预训练模型的信息，为强化学习中的状态表示提供了一种高效且性能优良的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Result: 实验发现只要训练分布充分覆盖任务空间，神经网络能实现组合泛化，且隐层激活能线性解码任务组成，解码能力与生成模型组合失败相关。

Conclusion: 扩大数据与模型规模是神经网络实现组合性泛化的关键，隐藏层线性可解码特性是组合泛化成功的标志。

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Conclusion: DeCoLe有效解决了偏见感知的标注错误检测问题，可作为提升数据可靠性的重要工具，指导组织数据管理实践。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种稳定、高效且易集成的库普曼算子奇异函数学习方案，提升了动力系统分析的实用性和扩展能力。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Conclusion: 通过充分利用多个LLMs的互补预测能力，MUSE有效提升了模型的不确定性量化与性能，适合高风险场景应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Method: 在GPT-2架构下，针对八种注意力机制进行训练，测量训练时间、GPU内存、FLOPS、CPU使用率和功耗等指标。

Result: 优化内核实现的注意力机制（如Flash Attention、LSH Attention、MLA）在能效方面表现最佳，且降低GPU功率不一定减少总能耗，训练时间也很关键。

Conclusion: 能耗敏感的基准测试对注意力机制设计至关重要，本文为选择资源高效的机制提供了实践参考。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Motivation: 传统的手腕IMU或单一传感器方法在食物摄入手势检测中表现有限，多模态融合能否进一步提升性能且在缺失某一模态时仍保持鲁棒性，是当前的挑战。

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

*Julianna Piskorz,Krzysztof Kacprzyk,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于建模治疗效果随剂量和时间变化的动态轨迹的框架，提高了因果推断中治疗效果的解释性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平均治疗效果（ATE）指标在医疗等领域未能捕捉治疗效果随剂量和时间变化的动态信息，限制了临床决策的有效性。

Method: 基于SemanticODE框架，提出一种可解释的轨迹建模方法，将治疗效果表示为剂量和时间上的平滑曲面，支持结合临床先验知识进行分析和编辑。

Result: 该方法能准确地建模治疗效果动态轨迹，提供包括起效时间、最大效果和持续时间等临床相关信息，模型具有良好的解释性和可编辑性。

Conclusion: 所提方法实现了对治疗效果动态变化的透明、稳健和可验证建模，有助于促进高风险领域的严谨因果分析和实际临床决策。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TRIP的检验方法，用于检测依赖特征存在时，随机森林等复杂模型中置换特征重要性评分的不可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的置换特征重要性方法在特征之间存在依赖关系时会生成不真实的数据，导致结果误导，亟需一种能识别不可靠评分的检验方法。

Method: 提出TRIP测试，该方法假设条件少，能检测因模型外推导致的不可靠置换特征重要性评分，并进一步扩展至高维数据场景。

Result: 通过模拟数据和实际应用验证，TRIP测试能够有效识别置换特征重要性评分的不可靠情况。

Conclusion: TRIP为保障置换特征重要性分析的可靠性提供了有效工具，尤其适用于存在特征依赖的复杂模型环境中。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

Result: Q-chunking在多个长时 horizon稀疏奖励操作任务中，实现了较之前方法更优的离线性能和在线样本效率。

Conclusion: 动作序列块化结合TD方法有效缓解探索难题，显著提升离线到在线强化学习性能。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的DPVD-MARL算法有效提升了集群联邦学习中基站资源和用户调度的优化效率及模型训练性能，具备较好的收敛性和性能表现。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: ICM-CA框架有效防止窃听，提高协同训练的安全性和效率，具有实用应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Motivation: 无人机（UAV）民用空域的扩展对入侵检测系统（IDS）的稳定性和智能化提出了更高要求，传统异常检测方法难以识别未知攻击，且对隐蔽的对抗攻击反应不足。

Method: 设计一个多类别IDS分类器以识别已知攻击，并基于此用cGAN生成隐蔽对抗样本，随后通过CVAE利用负对数似然分数区分对抗样本与真实的异常分布，以提升检测效果。

Result: 基于CVAE的后悔分数检测方法在识别隐蔽对抗攻击方面显著优于传统的Mahalanobis距离检测方法。

Conclusion: 先进的概率模型对于增强IDS对基于生成模型的自适应网络攻击的防御能力至关重要，能够有效提升无人机系统的安全性。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Conclusion: 目标导向和前瞻的顺序规划显著提升了因果实验设计的效率和针对性，为有限预算的复杂因果推理提供有效方案。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种层次化图神经网络框架ATHENA，实现了患者临床特征与分子数据的整合，提升了亚临床动脉粥样硬化的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络方法虽能提取患者分子特征，但忽视了队列范围的临床特征及患者间的病理相关性，限制了对动脉粥样硬化不同进程的理解。

Method: ATHENA通过构建层次化网络，结合患者的临床特征和个体分子数据，优化分子指纹与队列模式的一致性，实现了多模态统一学习。

Result: 基于391名患者的临床数据，ATHENA在多个基线模型上将分类AUC提升了13%，F1分数提升了20%。

Conclusion: ATHENA实现了可解释的亚型患者发现，增强了个性化干预策略，有助于动脉粥样硬化的疾病进程预测和临床管理。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Motivation: 当前RLHF框架中奖励模型易被“奖励黑客”利用缺陷，且现有方法在分布外数据表现不佳，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出联合训练基于Bradley--Terry损失的单目标模型和多目标回归模型，利用共享嵌入空间，结合两者优势以提升模型鲁棒性和评分能力。

Conclusion: 统一的奖励建模框架有效缓解了奖励黑客问题并增强了奖励模型的泛化能力，是提升RLHF性能的有效措施。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal

transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Motivation: 传统机器学习CV方法侧重于区分亚稳态，未能充分编码动力学信息，影响采样准确性。

Method: 通过时间滞后条件生成模型直接学习CV，建模时间滞后条件分布以捕捉分子运动的慢动力学行为。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide系统上，TLC结合SMD和OPES采样方法表现优于或等同于现有方法，在转变路径采样和状态区分上效果出色。

Conclusion: TLC框架有效捕捉慢动力学特征，提升了罕见事件采样的准确性和效率，推动分子动力学增强采样方法的发展。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动评估方法缺乏语义理解，计算成本高且受限于自动定理证明的进展，难以有效评价自然语言到形式语言的转换质量。

Method: 提出GTED框架，先对形式语句进行标准化，转换成操作树，再通过计算广义树编辑距离来衡量语义相似度。

Result: GTED在miniF2F和ProofNet两个基准测试中，准确性和Kappa分数均优于所有基线指标，表现出更高的评估性能。

Conclusion: GTED为语句自动形式化的自动化评估提供了一种更具语义理解力且准确的标凖化度量方式，具有较强的实用价值。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Conclusion: 提出的多任务提示框架有效解决了预训练与下游任务不匹配的问题，增强了异构图神经网络在多任务场景下的表现。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Result: 发现神经网络激活的几何关系表达了历史到未来的概率分布，且这种表征不依赖具体网络架构，表现出无法由有限经典电路实现的表征能力。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络能够自发学习并表示复杂的生成模型信念，体现出类似贝叶斯推断的动态更新机制，且其激活几何结构具有普适性，拓展了对神经网络内在工作机制的理解。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

Result: 在多个实验中，DTME-MTL框架显著提升了多任务模型性能，且计算开销极低，显示出良好的扩展性和实用性。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为基于Transformer的多任务学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，有效缓解了负迁移问题，提高了多任务学习的整体表现。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习在BCI中表现出色，但其置信度估计过于自信，限制了实际应用。研究旨在比较传统和深度学习方法在不确定性量化上的效果。

Method: 比较了基于传统的CSP-LDA和MDRM（包括温度缩放调整）与深度学习方法（深度集成、直接不确定性量化和标准CNN）在运动想象BCI中的不确定性量化能力。

Result: 发现深度学习通常过于自信，而CSP-LDA和MDRM-T在不确定性估计上表现更优，深度学习模型分类准确率更高；同时所有模型均能区分易错与难辨样本。

Conclusion: 通过识别并拒绝高不确定性样本，可提高运动想象BCI的准确率；传统方法在置信度估计方面表现更可靠，但深度学习模型分类性能优越。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

Motivation: 现有的Prover-Verifier游戏虽然有助于模型验证，但未应用于高维图像等复杂输入；概念瓶颈模型（CBM）虽提高了可解释性，但受制于线性预测能力有限。

Method: 引入NCV框架，使用最小监督的概念发现模型从原始输入提取结构化概念编码，Prover选取编码子集，Verifier采用非线性预测器基于选定编码做决策。

Result: NCV在高维、逻辑复杂的数据集上表现优于CBM和基于像素的PVG分类器，同时降低模型的捷径行为。

Conclusion: NCV展示了结合PVG和概念编码的可解释、可验证AI模型的潜力，是向可验证AI迈进的重要一步。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网等领域产生大量高维多变量流式数据，需实时发现异常且不能存储历史数据，传统方法难以满足实时性和内存限制需求。

Method: 提出基于在线去相关学习的DAD方法，动态学习数据相关结构，逐样本单遍历检测异常，并设计实用的超参数调优策略以适应实时场景。

Result: 在多种公开基准数据集上，DAD相比最新方法，在不同异常类型下表现更稳定且优越，且具备较强的维度扩展性，适合实时高维流数据。

Conclusion: DAD实现了异常检测效果与计算效率的最佳平衡，特别适合高维、内存受限的实时异常检测场景，树立了新的技术标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 该框架提升了上下文感知低秩逼近的鲁棒性和适用性，为神经网络压缩和微调提供了更稳定可靠的工具。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Method: 作者基于O-RAN架构，采用元学习方法优化条件切换的资源分配和管理策略，提升CHO的效率和稳定性。

Result: 该方法在信号波动条件下，比3GPP现有基准性能提升至少180%，且具有强鲁棒性的动态后悔界保证。

Conclusion: 提出的元学习驱动的CHO优化框架有效解决了条件切换的新挑战，显著提升了切换成功率和延迟表现。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Result: 降维方法对聚类性能指标产生影响，利用改进的轮廓系数显著提升了聚类质量。

Conclusion: 该基于聚类和降维的映射方法可自动区分职业定义，为职业转换提供新途径，有助于统一不同职业数据库数据。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

self-organization with neural network sparsification to reduce energy and

Conclusion: SLOGAN通过稀疏因果发现与生成干预有效解决了因果与伪相关特征纠缠问题，为无监督图域适应提供了新的思路和技术路径。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于EEG的深度学习模型由于受个体间差异影响，泛化性能较差，亟需设计更适合EEG信号的新型网络架构。

Method: 引入基于深度卷积分词器的TransformEEG混合模型，在四个公共EEG数据集上使用嵌套交叉验证，和七种现有模型进行了公平比较。

Result: TransformEEG在平衡准确率中位数达到78.45%，且结果波动小，结合数据增强和阈值校正后准确率提升至80.10%。

Conclusion: TransformEEG在EEG数据的帕金森病检测中表现出更稳定、更准确的性能，显著降低了模型结果的变异性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

Conclusion: 该去中心化方案有效解决了传统方法的隐私与扩展性问题，具备企业级协作机器学习的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

TL;DR: 本文研究了有限宽度全连接ReLU网络中各层的有效维度（特征矩阵秩），推导了随机高斯权重下隐藏层激活矩阵期望秩的闭式表达式，发现秩亏缺以几何比率递减并存在深度上的“复活”峰值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索随机初始化的全连接ReLU网络不同层中隐藏激活矩阵的秩特性，深入理解深度网络的表达能力及其层次之间对子空间变化的影响。

Method: 基于随机高斯权重，推导了给定输入批次下每层隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩闭式表达式，证明了秩的几何衰减和子高斯浓缩界，同时分析了秩变化的振荡行为及其深度上的局部极值点。

Result: 证明期望有效维度随着层深几何衰减且出现规则的局部最大值点（“复活”深度），其秩接近满秩0.79倍输入大小。正交初始化或强负斜率Leaky-ReLU可保持近满秩，表明振荡秩行为是有限宽度ReLU网络特有。

Conclusion: 论文精确刻画了随机ReLU层如何在不同层之间交替压缩和部分恢复输入子空间的纬度，补充丰富了对深度网络表达性的理解，揭示了有效维度振荡的有限宽度现象。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

Conclusion: FedCBDR有效解决了联邦类增量学习中的类别不平衡问题，通过全局协调的类别级重放和动态温度调整，提升了模型在异构数据和任务不平衡环境下的性能，具有较强的应用前景。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该协议提升了对LLM安全性的评估准确性，深化了对模型行为的理解，有助于未来开发更安全的语言模型。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TRIX的特征感知对抗训练框架，通过针对强弱不同类别自适应分配不同强度的对抗扰动，有效提升了分类模型在对抗攻击下的公平性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法忽视了不同类别间的脆弱性差异，导致强类别更鲁棒，弱类别更易受攻击，产生对抗不公平现象。

Method: TRIX框架针对强类别施加较弱的有针对性对抗扰动，促进特征多样性；对弱类别施加较强的无针对性对抗扰动，增强其鲁棒性，同时结合类别加权损失和扰动强度调整。

Result: 在包括PGD和AutoAttack等强攻击的多个标准图像分类基准测试中，TRIX显著提高了最弱类别的对抗鲁棒性，减少了类别间鲁棒性差异，同时保持了整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX为实现公平有效的对抗防御提供了实用方法，有助于缓解类别间鲁棒性差距，推动对抗训练领域的发展。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Motivation: 传统生存预测方法只能利用单一数据类型，难以充分捕捉肿瘤生物学的复杂性，亟需一种多模态方法提升预测能力。

Method: SAMVAE采用多模态变分自编码器结构，包含6种数据模态的专用编码器，将输入映射到共享潜在空间，支持单风险和竞争风险的生存时间建模，结合参数化输出实现解读友好的临床统计。

Result: 在乳腺癌和低级别胶质瘤两个队列上处理多模态数据，经过优化后模型在生存分析及竞争风险情景下表现优异，且达到或超过当前多模态模型的性能。

Conclusion: SAMVAE是首个基于参数化多模态深度学习模型，同时支持竞争风险和连续时间事件建模，综合多种数据类型，为临床决策和生存分析提供了可解释、数据驱动的新工具。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Method: 通过推导softmax函数谱范数的闭式表达式得出精确的局部Lipschitz界，并设计Jacobian Softmax范数最小化（JaSMin）正则项以降低Lipschitz常数。

Result: 新界比现有方法更准确，解释了注意力分布对鲁棒性的影响，且JaSMin正则化增强了transformer的鲁棒性并降低了整体网络的局部Lipschitz常数。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的局部Lipschitz界和JaSMin正则项有效提升transformer的鲁棒性，具有较好的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich

ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Result: 校准后的预训练模型显著提升了填充值质量，从而大幅改善了决策过程的后悔值保证。

Conclusion: 准确的预训练模型在序贯决策任务中具有重要实际价值，“模型弹性”是理解和提升预训练模型在数据驱动决策中整合效果的关键指标。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Motivation: 自然梯度下降法变分推断虽在实践中收敛快，但理论收敛保证难以建立，尤其是对含凹型对数似然和高斯近似的情况。

Method: 通过对高斯协方差做平方根参数化，建立自然梯度变分高斯推断及其连续时间梯度流的收敛理论。

Result: 理论上证明了收敛性，并通过实验展示了自然梯度方法优于欧几里得和Wasserstein几何算法的优势。

Conclusion: 平方根参数化使得自然梯度变分推断不仅收敛快且具备理论保证，推荐自然梯度方法用于相关推断任务。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan

nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve

Conclusion: 从广义且原则性的角度理解DPO，对于拓展其应用、理解现有变体及避免偏离理论基础具重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Method: ApexOracle结合分子特征、基因组及文献信息，通过基础离散扩散语言模型和双重嵌入架构，既预测分子活性又生成新分子。

Result: 在多种细菌和化学体系中，ApexOracle的活性预测优于现有方法，且能够转移到鲜有或无抗菌数据的新病原体。

Conclusion: ApexOracle结合预测和分子设计，为抗击抗菌素抗药性和未来传染病爆发提供了可扩展且高效的策略。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UnIT的非结构化推理时剪枝方法，通过动态跳过不必要的乘加运算，实现微控制器上的高效神经网络推理，提升速度与降低能耗，同时无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法多在训练或编译时进行，且依赖结构化稀疏性，不适合不支持SIMD或并行计算的微控制器，未充分挖掘细粒度效率提升空间。

Method: UnIT在推理时基于输入激活模式动态识别并跳过不必要的乘加运算，将剪枝决策转为阈值比较替代乘法，并提出三种硬件友好的除法近似方法，优化计算复用和层级剪枝灵敏度。

Result: 在MSP430微控制器上，UnIT实现11.02%~82.03%的乘加运算减少，速度提升27.30%~84.19%，能耗降低27.33%~84.38%，同时保持0.48%~7%的准确率波动。对域变换任务，UnIT精度匹配或超越重新训练模型，且计算量更少。

Conclusion: 非结构化推理时剪枝为无需重新训练且适合MCU的高效深度神经网络部署提供了一种实际可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来生成模型带来隐私和版权风险，现有攻击多依赖高资源和完备训练集访问，实际风险未被充分揭示。

Method: 利用电商平台抓取数据的模板化布局及图像，结合领域知识设计提示词，识别能引发图像重构的模式化提示，从而实现低资源攻击。

Result: 实验证明，诸如“blue Unisex T-Shirt”等看似普通提示词竟可生成真实人物面部，表明训练数据能被无意识地重构出来。

Conclusion: 扩散模型训练数据因模板化和提示词模式化存在根本性漏洞，普通用户亦可能无意中触发隐私重构，亟需加强数据监管和防护机制。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

*Sukjun Hwang,Brandon Wang,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态分块机制和分层网络(H-Net)，实现了一种端到端的语言模型，替代传统的分词-语言建模-去分词流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型依赖静态分词步骤，限制了真正的端到端基础模型的发展。

Method: 引入动态内容和上下文相关的分块机制，结合显式层次网络，联合学习分块策略和语言建模。

Result: H-Net在字节级别表现优于基于BPE分词的强大Transformer模型，多层次层次结构进一步提升性能，且训练后的模型显示更强的字符级鲁棒性和数据依赖的分块能力。

Conclusion: 动态分块和层次结构能够增强端到端模型的表现，特别在分词困难或无分词语言和序列中展现出更高的数据效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

Result: 在微调已预训练策略和利用离线数据进行在线训练两种场景下，EXPO在样本效率上平均提升2-3倍，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入编辑策略辅助即时动作优化，EXPO有效解决了表达式策略在在线强化学习中梯度稳定传播的问题，提高了训练和微调的样本效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练模型能否无需微调，通过灵活调整层的结构来适应不同输入，从而提升效率和预测准确率。

Method: 将模型层设计为可跳过、重复或重新排序的模块，利用MCTS搜索最优的层组合链（CoLa）针对每个输入样本构建动态架构。

Result: 发现大多数正确预测样本可通过更短的CoLa实现，提升推理速度；超过60%的错误预测样本经过CoLa优化后获得正确结果，显著提升模型表现。

Conclusion: 固定架构限制了预训练LLM的性能，动态调整测试时的网络深度与结构能有效提升效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

Conclusion: GridTD作为一种通用且先进的压缩成像重建方法，兼具高效性与准确性，克服了现有连续表示模型的限制。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling

*Abrar Faiyaz,Nhat Hoang,Giovanni Schifitto,Md Nasir Uddin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ArteryX的半监督动脉评估工具箱，利用基于血管融合网络的标志点跟踪方法，实现对三维磁共振血管成像中脑血管特征的高效准确量化，解决了传统方法的用户依赖性和断裂血管问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑血管病理对认知衰退和神经疾病影响显著，但现有3D TOF MRA评估方法多关注大动脉异常，忽视微妙血管变化的定量分析，且现有方法存在用户依赖性强、学习曲线陡峭和缺乏标准化验证等问题。

Method: 提出ArteryX半监督框架，基于MATLAB实现，采用血管融合网络的标志点追踪方法，能够有效管理追踪路径和断裂血管问题，处理时间约10-15分钟，含有体内动脉模拟框架以实现定量特征验证。

Result: 在脑小血管病患者中，ArteryX表现出对微妙血管变化的更高灵敏度和优于现有半自动方法的性能，且实现了快速处理和准确量化。

Conclusion: ArteryX工具箱具备标准化定量特征提取和验证能力，有望成为血管特征提取的基准工具，促进临床早期脑血管病变检测及不同患者队列间的标准化比较，推动脑血管健康研究发展。

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.

### [238] [Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07115)
*Javal Vyas,Mehmet Mercangoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）和有限状态机（FSM）的统一智能体框架，实现了化工过程中的故障恢复规划与连续过程控制的结合。该框架通过多智能体协作及反馈循环有效提升故障恢复计划的有效性和控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代化工过程日益复杂，且面临人员短缺及复杂故障场景，亟需融合符号推理与自适应控制的新型自动化方法。

Method: 构建了一个基于有限状态机的框架，利用LLM驱动规划智能体生成恢复序列，模拟智能体执行状态转移，验证智能体通过循环提示不断优化无效计划，并在实验室平台上验证了该方法的控制效果。

Result: 在随机生成的有限状态机测试中，GPT-4o系列模型通过五次提示调整实现了100%的有效路径成功率，优于开源模型；在实验室双加热器控制任务中，LLM控制器性能与经典PID控制相当，且提示循环对处理非线性动力学至关重要。

Conclusion: 结构化反馈与模块化智能体使得LLM能够统一高层符号规划和低层连续控制，为化工中的语言驱动鲁棒自动化奠定基础。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BOOST方法，通过动态调整温度缩放和采样概率，解决艺术品分类中因数据偏斜导致的模型偏差问题，实现了公平性和准确性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前艺术品分类中的AI模型存在严重的偏差问题，主要源于训练数据中不同艺术风格分布不均，导致模型对罕见风格的分类准确性低，因此有必要设计一种能有效缓解偏差的方法。

Method: 本文提出了基于OOD信息的模型偏差自适应采样方法BOOST，该方法通过动态调整温度缩放和采样概率，促进各类别的均衡表示，从而减少类别间的偏差。

Result: 在KaoKore和PACS数据集上的实验表明，BOOST方法能够有效降低类别间偏差，同时保持模型的整体高性能。并提出了新的度量指标SODC来评估类别分离和偏差减缓效果。

Conclusion: BOOST方法在艺术品分类中成功实现了公平性与准确性的平衡，是解决训练数据偏斜导致AI模型偏差问题的有效方案。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在动态游戏互动中表现出色，但在遵守复杂交易规则时存在物品幻觉和计算错误，导致规则违规和玩家信任下降。

Method: 作者将交易过程分解为六个状态，设计了统一的提示框架，结合自主的对话状态推断和上下文特定的规则遵守，包括上下文感知的物品引用和基于占位符的价格计算。

Result: 在100次交易对话的评估中，SIBP实现了超过97%的状态遵守率，超过95%的物品引用准确率，以及99.7%的计算精度，且保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: SIBP显著优于基线方法，为商业游戏中可信赖的NPC交互奠定了实际基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode
player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable
trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule
adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified
prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and
placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues
demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7%
calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while
outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for
trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

Conclusion: 神经符号结合大语言模型的方法有效应对供应链非法活动的稀疏和不可靠数据问题，促进自动化监测手段发展。

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents

writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的翻译系统虽具备强大文本处理能力，但通常只限于文本输入，缺乏对多模态信息的利用，限制了翻译效果和适应性。

Method: ViDove引入视觉和上下文背景信息，结合多模态记忆系统及包含领域知识的长短期记忆模块，模仿人类译者工作流程，实现更精准和自适应的翻译。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

Method: 本文通过理论分析和在密码学困难假设下的证明，展示了对提示和输出过滤面临的计算不可行性，并讨论了放宽缓解措施的复杂性。

Result: 结果表明，存在无法有效过滤的对抗提示，输出过滤在自然设定下计算上不可行，外部黑盒过滤无法确保安全且与模型内部紧密相关。

Conclusion: 安全性无法单靠外部过滤器实现，模型的智能与判断不可分离，强调需从模型架构和权重层面进行对齐设计。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec框架有效结合模拟与决策，提升供应链运输策略设计的效果与稳定性，具有较强的泛化能力和实用价值。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

Conclusion: 结构化推理、多智能体协作和反馈驱动搜索机制是提升大语言模型在药物发现应用中表现的关键，有助于拓展其科学领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used

*Zhixiang Su,Di Wang,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Context Pooling的新方法，通过图池化提升图神经网络在知识图谱链接预测中的性能，实现了针对查询的特定图生成，尤其适用于训练中未见实体的归纳设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的知识图谱链接预测方法中，传统的聚合方式对模型性能提升有限，亟需新的方法来增强模型的预测能力。

Method: 提出Context Pooling方法，利用图池化技术筛选出与查询逻辑相关的邻居节点，设计了邻居精度和邻居召回两个指标，用以评估邻居的逻辑相关性，从而构建查询相关的子图，适配归纳学习环境。

Result: 该方法通用性强，分别应用于两个最新模型，在三个公开的传导和归纳数据集上进行测试，在48种设置中有42种达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Context Pooling有效提升了基于图神经网络的知识图谱链接预测性能，特别是在归纳学习场景下，通过生成查询特定子图，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Motivation: 为了有效推断可信网络中的不确定性，尤其是在链状子类结构中，实现既快速又稳健的信念推断。

Method: 结合Dempster-Shafer理论，设计了一种利用信念函数和似然函数进行不确定性传播的推断框架，并将其与经典灵敏度分析进行比较。

Result: 数值实验展示了该方法在链状可信网络中的优势与局限，证明了其在实际应用中的有效性与稳健性。

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for
propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains.
The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief

uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based
inference methods and comparing belief-based inference against classical
sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and
limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

*Fedor Rodionov,Abdelrahman Eldesokey,Michael Birsak,John Femiani,Bernard Ghanem,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanQA 是一个评估大型语言模型几何和空间推理能力的基准测试，基于室内场景的结构化符号表示，涵盖度量和拓扑推理及室内设计约束。实验证明现有模型在浅层查询上表现尚可，但在物理约束模拟、空间一致性维护及布局扰动下泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在真实世界布局的空间和几何推理上存在明显盲点，缺乏准确推理和操作这些属性的能力。

Method: 构建基于室内场景的结构化符号布局（如JSON、XML），设计涵盖距离、可见性、最短路径及室内设计约束（可用性、平衡等）的多样化问题，形成PlanQA基准测试集。

Result: 测试多款前沿开源与商业大型语言模型发现，它们在浅层问题上表现良好，但难以处理物理约束和空间一致性，且对布局扰动的泛化能力较弱。

Conclusion: PlanQA揭示了当前大型语言模型在真实世界空间布局推理上的不足，促使未来研究开发能准确推断和操作空间与几何属性的语言模型。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

TL;DR: 本文分析了直接偏好优化（DPO）的方法及其理论性质，指出了DPO对初始化敏感且可能导致概率分配错误，进而加剧模型偏差。为此，提出了一种稳定的偏好优化框架，通过引入双层优化和正则化策略，改进DPO以实现更稳定和准确的模型对齐。实验表明该方法在推理和摘要任务中表现优于标准DPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DPO在实际中取得成功，但其理论性质和局限性尚未被充分研究，特别是其敏感性和概率错误分配可能导致模型偏差加剧，从而影响模型对齐的稳定性和一致性。

Method: 提出一种基于双层优化的稳定偏好优化框架，结合强化监督微调和改进的DPO目标函数，通过正则化鼓励对偏好输出的绝对概率提升，同时保持优化过程的稳定性。

Result: 在推理和摘要等挑战性基准测试中，该方法提升了推理准确率，并更好地使输出分布与期望偏好一致，表现优于标准DPO。

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好驱动的模型对齐目标设计提供了新见解，提升了对齐的可靠性和可解释性，推动了语言模型更有效的对齐方法发展。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小提琴轮廓线区分尺寸缩减或非缩减的分类方法，利用三维几何数据和曲线拟合参数，成功实现了几何特征对尺寸缩减的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史上的尺寸标准化导致部分小提琴尺寸缩减，这种缩减影响小提琴的轮廓线，但缺乏定量研究。

Method: 利用摄影测量获取25把小提琴的三维网格，提取均匀间隔的轮廓线，用基于两参数的抛物线拟合曲线，并计算多种特征进行分类分析。

Result: 几何特征能够在一定程度上区分尺寸缩减与非缩减小提琴，其中曲线开口参数（beta）最具预测性。

Conclusion: 尺寸缩减对小提琴轮廓线影响显著，基于几何参数的分类方法为小提琴尺寸研究提供了定量工具。

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了繁荣AI基准（FAI Benchmark），通过七个维度评估AI与人类繁荣的对齐度，采用1229个问题和几何平均分确保全面评估。测试显示目前顶尖语言模型尚未在所有维度上达到理想对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准多关注AI技术能力或防止伤害，缺乏衡量AI促进人类全面繁荣的框架。

Method: 设计涵盖七个繁荣维度的评估框架，包含1229个主客观题目，利用大型语言模型作为评判者，采用几何平均分衡量平衡表现。

Result: 对28款领先语言模型测试发现最高分为72/100，部分维度如信仰、品格和意义表现特别不足。

Conclusion: 提出的FAI基准为AI系统设计和评估提供了促进人类全面繁荣的新方向，推动AI伦理和发展，从单纯避免伤害向积极支持人类福祉转变。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用专家混合模型需要大量训练数据和复杂优化，且难以实现高效且精细的技能学习。受人类驾驶学习过程启发，作者希望通过分技能、分步骤的方式提升模型性能和效率。

Method: 提出技能导向路由机制，定义并标注具体驾驶技能，建立分层技能数据集，通过预训练路由器实现分步思考，整合描述、推理、规划等辅助任务于单次前向传播，减少计算开销。

Result: 模型以少于30亿的稀疏激活参数，优于多个80亿参数以上模型，在CODA自动驾驶复杂场景推理任务中表现领先，同时激活模型参数规模至少减少62.5%。

Conclusion: MoSE模型通过技能导向和分步推理策略，有效提升了自动驾驶模型的性能和计算效率，实现了少参数下的最先进性能。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Motivation: 当前大规模神经网络模型依赖扩展数据和模型规模，导致环境、经济和伦理方面的高成本，不利于可持续发展和公平访问。

Method: 借鉴生物感官系统的动态适应机制，主动调整传感器参数（如曝光、灵敏度、模态组合），减少协变量偏移，提高小型模型性能。

Result: 实验证明，自适应传感使得小型模型（EfficientNet-B0）表现优于数据和计算需求更大的大型模型（OpenCLIP-H）。

Conclusion: 提出了自适应传感在多个领域的广泛应用前景，讨论了技术与伦理挑战，推荐了标准化基准、实时算法、多模态集成和隐私保护等未来研究方向，以推动可持续且公平的人工智能发展。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Motivation: 传统的因果解释方法侧重于因素与结果的关系，但非专业用户更关注实际导致结果的事实；且现有识别实际因果的方法计算复杂且缺乏实用解法。

Method: 设计了一套算法，在保持多项式时间复杂度的同时，能够调节计算的精准度和全面性，适用于多种系统类型。

Result: 实验表明算法能有效识别非布尔、黑盒及随机系统的实际原因，且通过增加计算时间可提高精准度和覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该算法为实际因果识别提供了实用且高效的解决方案，拓展了解释性人工智能的应用范围。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Conclusion: AI模型能力的趋同趋势要求重新审视AI策略与政策，未来更多重视中小规模模型的能力和角色。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

Method: 在Cartographer系统中，使用AgileX LIMO机器人进行真实环境映射实验，比较两种求解器的速度、收敛效率及地图清晰度。

Result: Ceres在速度、收敛效率和整体地图清晰度上优于g2o，收敛迭代次数更少，地图更准确；g2o在局部障碍物检测方面表现更好。

Conclusion: Ceres适合整体SLAM优化以提高手速和地图质量，而g2o在特定场景下具有局部环境感知优势，二者各有优劣。

Abstract: This article presents a comparative analysis of g2o and Ceres solvers in

accuracy of the g2o solver in comparison to the Ceres solver, which is the
default in Cartographer. In our experiments comparing Ceres and g2o within
Cartographer, Ceres outperformed g2o in terms of speed, convergence efficiency,
and overall map clarity. Ceres required fewer iterations and less time to
converge, producing more accurate and well-defined maps, especially in
real-world mapping scenarios with the AgileX LIMO robot. However, g2o excelled
in localized obstacle detection, highlighting its value in specific situations.

Abstract: Robotic dressing assistance has the potential to improve the quality of life
for individuals with limited mobility. Existing solutions predominantly rely on
rigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable
garments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior
robotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control
strategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and
adaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the
Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth
mechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches,the
SWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling based deployment method,
eliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient
dressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its
design and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance.
The proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various
garment configurations, presenting a promising alternative to conventional
robotic dressing assistance.

Abstract: Navigation and inspection in confined environments, such as tunnels and
pipes, pose significant challenges for existing robots due to limitations in
maneuverability and adaptability to varying geometries. Vine robots, which are
soft growing continuum robots that extend their length through soft material
eversion at their tip, offer unique advantages due to their ability to navigate
tight spaces, adapt to complex paths, and minimize friction. However, existing
vine robot designs struggle with navigation in manmade and natural passageways,
with branches and sharp 3D turns. In this letter, we introduce a steerable vine
robot specifically designed for pipe and burrow environments. The robot
features a simple tubular body and an external tip mount that steers the vine
robot in three degrees of freedom by changing the growth direction and, when
necessary, bracing against the wall of the pipe or burrow. Our external tip
steering approach enables: (1) active branch selection in 3D space with a
maximum steerable angle of 51.7{\deg}, (2) navigation of pipe networks with
radii as small as 2.5 cm, (3) a compliant tip enabling navigation of sharp
turns, and (4) real-time 3D localization in GPS-denied environments using
tip-mounted sensors and continuum body odometry. We describe the forward
kinematics, characterize steerability, and demonstrate the system in a 3D pipe
system as well as a natural animal burrow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义导航缺乏专注于语言理解与物体定位精确度的基准，难以全面评测导航智能体对语言描述的理解能力。

Method: 构建了精细校验的LangNav数据集，设计LangNavBench对不同层次的语言描述进行系统评测，提出MLFM方法，通过多层语义地图增强对小物体和空间关系描述的处理能力。

Result: MLFM在LangNav数据集上优于当前最先进的基于地图的导航方法，LangNavBench能有效衡量模型对属性、空间、关系及类别层级的理解和导航表现。

Conclusion: LangNav及LangNavBench首次提供了一个语言中心的评测平台，促进了基于语言的语义导航研究，MLFM方法有效提升了导航智能体在复杂语言描述下的表现。

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in
language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target
object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a
clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the
words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set
dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects
described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine
attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was
manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and
semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a
benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand
and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench
allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,
spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first
thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also
present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable
multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small
objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms
state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

### [268] [Classifying Emergence in Robot Swarms: An Observer-Dependent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07315)
*Ricardo Vega,Cameron Nowzari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架，通过区分可观测状态与隐含状态，明确群体和涌现的定义，强调这些概念带有主观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对群体（swarm）和涌现（emergence）的正式定义存在分歧，影响新手及专家的理解和交流。

Method: 通过分离外部可观测状态与内部潜在不可观测状态，构建一个统一框架，评估现有定义的共通性。

Result: 发现群体和涌现的定义更多取决于观察者的视角和隐性知识，而非系统本身特性。

Conclusion: 群体不仅由群行为定义，更应考虑产生该行为的过程；此框架有助于区分多机器人系统与真正的群体，为群体机器人系统设计提供理论支持。

Abstract: Emergence and swarms are widely discussed topics, yet no consensus exists on
their formal definitions. This lack of agreement makes it difficult not only
for new researchers to grasp these concepts, but also for experts who may use
the same terms to mean different things. Many attempts have been made to
objectively define 'swarm' or 'emergence,' with recent work highlighting the
role of the external observer. Still, several researchers argue that once an
observer's vantage point (e.g., scope, resolution, context) is established, the
terms can be made objective or measured quantitatively. In this note, we
propose a framework to discuss these ideas rigorously by separating externally
observable states from latent, unobservable ones. This allows us to compare and
contrast existing definitions of swarms and emergence on common ground. We
argue that these concepts are ultimately subjective-shaped less by the system
itself than by the perception and tacit knowledge of the observer.
Specifically, we suggest that a 'swarm' is not defined by its group behavior
alone, but by the process generating that behavior. Our broader goal is to
support the design and deployment of robotic swarm systems, highlighting the
critical distinction between multi-robot systems and true swarms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究提出将触觉反馈从手部移至手腕，利用可穿戴触觉设备改善远程机器人辅助手术中的力反馈感知。实验显示，手腕触觉反馈显著降低力的误差，但操作时延长了移动时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手部触觉反馈虽能提升手术性能，但妨碍对操纵杆的直接操作，故探讨将触觉反馈移至手腕的可行性。

Method: 使用达芬奇研究套件，参与者在有无手腕触觉反馈情况下，对假体组织进行力度感知任务，评估力度准确性和操作时间。

Result: 手腕触觉反馈显著降低力度误差，但使运动时间加长，表明反馈改变了速度-准确度的权衡。

Conclusion: 将触觉反馈移至手腕通过可穿戴设备有效提升力感知准确性，且对操作策略有所影响，具备应用潜力。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that the addition of haptic feedback to the hands can
improve awareness of tool-tissue interactions and enhance performance of
teleoperated tasks in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However,
hand-based haptic feedback occludes direct interaction with the manipulanda of
surgeon console in teleoperated surgical robots. We propose relocating haptic
feedback to the wrist using a wearable haptic device so that haptic feedback
mechanisms do not need to be integrated into the manipulanda. However, it is
unknown if such feedback will be effective, given that it is not co-located
with the finger movements used for manipulation. To test if relocated haptic
feedback improves force application during teleoperated tasks using da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot, participants learned to palpate a phantom
tissue to desired forces. A soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device with an
anchoring system renders tool-tissue interaction forces to the wrist of the
user. Participants performed the palpation task with and without wrist-worn
haptic feedback and were evaluated for the accuracy of applied forces.
Participants demonstrated statistically significant lower force error when
wrist-worn haptic feedback was provided. Participants also performed the
palpation task with longer movement times when provided wrist-worn haptic
feedback, indicating that the haptic feedback may have caused participants to
operate at a different point in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve.

Conclusion: UniTracker提供了一种简单而强大的方法，可扩展且实用地实现表达丰富且稳定的人形机器人全身运动跟踪控制。

Abstract: Humanoid robots must achieve diverse, robust, and generalizable whole-body
control to operate effectively in complex, human-centric environments. However,
existing methods, particularly those based on teacher-student frameworks often
suffer from a loss of motion diversity during policy distillation and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen behaviors. In this work, we present
UniTracker, a simplified yet powerful framework that integrates a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) into the student policy to explicitly model the
latent diversity of human motion. By leveraging a learned CVAE prior, our
method enables the student to retain expressive motion characteristics while
improving robustness and adaptability under partial observations. The result is
a single policy capable of tracking a wide spectrum of whole-body motions with
high fidelity and stability. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world deployments demonstrate that UniTracker significantly outperforms
MLP-based DAgger baselines in motion quality, generalization to unseen
references, and deployment robustness, offering a practical and scalable
solution for expressive humanoid control.

Conclusion: 本文所提框架有效解决了软体机器人运动学建模中的预测不确定性问题，为软体机器人运动学建模提供了一种准确且具理论保障的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design
for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear
and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine
learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics.
However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively
affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling
in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and
real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine
learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The
results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust
generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling
framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify
predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction
intervals with a theoretical guarantee.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对动态且未知环境中目标不可预测和环境不确定性的挑战，现有方法依赖全局信息，效率和适应性不足。

Method: 引入信息素逆向引导机制，将其嵌入深度强化学习的观察空间，通过局部通信实现去中心化合作，减少对全局通信的依赖，构建基于DRL的多智能体架构。

Result: 大量实验表明，结合局部通信和信息素引导显著提升了搜索效率、适应性及系统鲁棒性，在动态和通信受限场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PILOC为多智能体搜索救援任务提供了一种有效、灵活的解决方案，具有良好的应用前景，尤其适合动态复杂环境下的应急响应。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster
response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown
environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and
environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a
framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local
perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance
mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization.
PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication,
significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional
heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based
on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based
multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that
combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly
boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to
existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and
communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future
MASAR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶运动规划模块功能安全难以保障，特别是涉及复杂或学习型软件时，且在线验证方法尚未充分集成到嵌入式实时系统中。

Method: 开发了带时间保障的新型在线验证框架，结合约束基可行性检查和基于代价的合理性度量，在实时操作系统上原型实现轨迹候选评估。

Conclusion: 提出了一个模块化且可扩展的实时轨迹验证框架，适合汽车级硬件部署，未来将完成全部保障逻辑并通过硬件在环和实车测试验证其有效性。

Abstract: Ensuring the functional safety of motion planning modules in autonomous
vehicles remains a critical challenge, especially when dealing with complex or
learning-based software. Online verification has emerged as a promising
approach to monitor such systems at runtime, yet its integration into embedded
real-time environments remains limited. This work presents a safeguarding
concept for motion planning that extends prior approaches by introducing a time
safeguard. While existing methods focus on geometric and dynamic feasibility,
our approach additionally monitors the temporal consistency of planning outputs
to ensure timely system response. A prototypical implementation on a real-time
operating system evaluates trajectory candidates using constraint-based
feasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics. Preliminary results
show that the safeguarding module operates within real-time bounds and
effectively detects unsafe trajectories. However, the full integration of the
time safeguard logic and fallback strategies is ongoing. This study contributes
a modular and extensible framework for runtime trajectory verification and
highlights key aspects for deployment on automotive-grade hardware. Future work
includes completing the safeguarding logic and validating its effectiveness
through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and vehicle-based testing. The code is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个结合基于证据学习的场景坐标回归（SCR）位姿估计器和滑动视界轨迹优化器的感知驱动框架，实现了在无GPS的室内环境中自主飞行时高精度、低漂移的定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在无GPS的室内环境中自主飞行需要准确且漂移受控的视觉定位，以保证导航的可靠性和精确性。传统的视觉惯性测程（VIO）方法存在漂移问题，亟需提升绝对位姿估计的精度和稳定性。

Method: 采用基于证据学习的场景坐标回归（SCR）位姿估计器结合滑动视界轨迹优化器，引导摄像头对准预测不确定性低的像素，同时利用固定时滞平滑器将低频SCR数据和高频IMU数据实时融合形成感知控制闭环。

Conclusion: 本文提出的感知驱动框架有效提升了无人机在无GPS室内环境中的定位精度和可靠性，为高精度自主飞行提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous flight in GPS denied indoor spaces requires trajectories that keep
visual localization error tightly bounded across varied missions. Whereas
visual inertial odometry (VIO) accumulates drift over time, scene coordinate
regression (SCR) yields drift-free, high accuracy absolute pose estimation. We
present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based
SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer
steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable
scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream
with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In
simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15%
(40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively.
Moreover, hardware in the loop experiment validates the feasibility of our
proposed framework.

this work, we present FiDTouch, a 3D wearable haptic device that delivers
cutaneous stimuli to the finger pad, such as contact, pressure, encounter, skin
stretch, and vibrotactile feedback. The application of a tiny inverted Delta
robot in the mechanism design allows providing accurate contact and fast
changing dynamic stimuli to the finger pad surface. The performance of the
developed display was evaluated in a two-stage user study of the perception of
static spatial contact stimuli and skin stretch stimuli generated on the finger
pad. The proposed display, by providing users with precise touch and force
stimuli, can enhance user immersion and efficiency in the fields of
human-computer and human-robot interactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电缆驱动并联机器人在负载操作中需要监测异常（风 gusts 及电缆冲击）以保证平台安全运行，但依赖额外传感器复杂且成本高，故探索仅用电机转矩数据检测异常的可能性。

Method: 基于高斯混合模型构建异常检测算法。算法先在短暂非异常数据校准，随后实时通过马氏距离与统计阈值判断异常，定期更新模型参数以适应环境变化。

Result: 14次长时间测试显示本方法达到100%真正率与95.4%平均真负率，检测延迟仅1秒，且在对比功率阈值与非自适应GMM方法中表现出更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 仅通过电机转矩数据并结合自适应GMM算法即可高效准确检测CDPR中异常，避免额外传感器需求，提高系统鲁棒性与实用性。

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load
manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At
each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the
cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by
detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or
cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using
only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,
unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a
brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on
known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using
Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds
triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the
latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.
Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind
intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%
average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative
evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates
higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

Abstract: The integration of high-level assistance algorithms in surgical robotics
training curricula may be beneficial in establishing a more comprehensive and
robust skillset for aspiring surgeons, improving their clinical performance as
a consequence. This work presents the development and validation of a
haptic-enhanced Virtual Reality simulator for surgical robotics training,
featuring 8 surgical tasks that the trainee can interact with thanks to the
embedded physics engine. This virtual simulated environment is augmented by the
introduction of high-level haptic interfaces for robotic assistance that aim at
re-directing the motion of the trainee's hands and wrists toward targets or
away from obstacles, and providing a quantitative performance score after the
execution of each training exercise.An experimental study shows that the
introduction of enhanced robotic assistance into a surgical robotics training
curriculum improves performance during the training process and, crucially,
promotes the transfer of the acquired skills to an unassisted surgical
scenario, like the clinical one.

Abstract: Robot swarms offer the potential to serve a variety of distributed sensing
applications. An interesting real-world application that stands to benefit
significantly from deployment of swarms is structural monitoring, where
traditional sensor networks face challenges in structural coverage due to their
static nature. This paper investigates the deployment of a swarm of
miniaturized vibration sensing robots to inspect and localize structural
damages on a surface section within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In
particular, we consider a 1 m x 1 m x 3 mm steel surface section and utilize
finite element analysis using Abaqus to obtain realistic structural vibration
data. The resulting vibration data is imported into the physics-based robotic
simulator Webots, where we simulate the dynamics of our surface inspecting
robot swarm. We employ (i) Gaussian process estimators to guide the robots'
exploration as they collect vibration samples across the surface and (ii)
operational modal analysis to detect structural damages by estimating and
comparing existing and intact structural vibration patterns. We analyze the
influence of exploration radii on estimation uncertainty and assess the
effectiveness of our method across 10 randomized scenarios, where the number,
locations, surface area, and depth of structural damages vary. Our simulation
studies validate the efficacy of our miniaturized robot swarm for
vibration-based structural inspection.

Abstract: Despite their recent introduction to human society, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have significantly affected the way we tackle mental challenges in our
everyday lives. From optimizing our linguistic communication to assisting us in
making important decisions, LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are notably reducing our
cognitive load by gradually taking on an increasing share of our mental
activities. In the context of Learning by Demonstration (LbD), classifying and
segmenting complex motions into primitive actions, such as pushing, pulling,
twisting etc, is considered to be a key-step towards encoding a task. In this
work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to undertake this task,
considering a finite set of predefined primitive actions found in fruit picking
operations. By utilizing LLMs instead of simple supervised learning or analytic
methods, we aim at making the method easily applicable and deployable in a
real-life scenario. Three different fine-tuning approaches are investigated,
compared on datasets captured kinesthetically, using a UR10e robot, during a
fruit-picking scenario.

Motivation: 现有基于特征的视觉SLAM系统在照明变化大、特征跟踪不稳定的环境下表现差，缺乏适应性调整机制。

Method: 提出图像增强预处理、基于图像熵等动态调整特征检测灵敏度，以及基于密度分布和照明影响因子的特征剔除策略。

Conclusion: 自适应前端策略在提升视觉SLAM系统鲁棒性方面效果明显，且计算开销未显著增加。

Abstract: Robust Visual SLAM (vSLAM) is essential for autonomous systems operating in
real-world environments, where challenges such as dynamic objects, low texture,
and critically, varying illumination conditions often degrade performance.
Existing feature-based SLAM systems rely on fixed front-end parameters, making
them vulnerable to sudden lighting changes and unstable feature tracking. To
address these challenges, we propose ``IRAF-SLAM'', an Illumination-Robust and
Adaptive Feature-Culling front-end designed to enhance vSLAM resilience in
complex and challenging environments. Our approach introduces: (1) an image
enhancement scheme to preprocess and adjust image quality under varying
lighting conditions; (2) an adaptive feature extraction mechanism that
dynamically adjusts detection sensitivity based on image entropy, pixel
intensity, and gradient analysis; and (3) a feature culling strategy that
filters out unreliable feature points using density distribution analysis and a
lighting impact factor. Comprehensive evaluations on the TUM-VI and European
Robotics Challenge (EuRoC) datasets demonstrate that IRAF-SLAM significantly
reduces tracking failures and achieves superior trajectory accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art vSLAM methods under adverse illumination conditions. These
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive front-end strategies in
improving vSLAM robustness without incurring significant computational
overhead. The implementation of IRAF-SLAM is publicly available at
https://thanhnguyencanh. github.io/IRAF-SLAM/.

Conclusion: 该人机协作系统能够精准执行下颌角劈开术，有效提升手术精度与安全性。

Abstract: Mandibular Angle Split Osteotomy (MASO) is a significant procedure in oral
and maxillofacial surgery. Despite advances in technique and instrumentation,
its success still relies heavily on the surgeon's experience. In this work, a
human-robot collaborative system is proposed to perform MASO according to a
preoperative plan and under guidance of a surgeon. A task decomposition
methodology is used to divide the collaborative surgical procedure into three
subtasks: (1) positional control and (2) orientation control, both led by the
robot for precise alignment; and (3) force-control, managed by surgeon to
ensure safety. Additionally, to achieve patient tracking without the need for a
skull clamp, an optical tracking system (OTS) is utilized. Movement of the
patient mandibular is measured with an optical-based tracker mounted on a
dental occlusal splint. A registration method and Robot-OTS calibration method
are introduced to achieve reliable navigation within our framework. The
experiments of drilling were conducted on the realistic phantom model, which
demonstrated that the average error between the planned and actual drilling
points is 1.85mm.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升四足机器人的动态负载适应能力，具备良好的实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Unknown dynamic load carrying is one important practical application for
quadruped robots. Such a problem is non-trivial, posing three major challenges
in quadruped locomotion control. First, how to model or represent the dynamics
of the load in a generic manner. Second, how to make the robot capture the
dynamics without any external sensing. Third, how to enable the robot to
interact with load handling the mutual effect and stabilizing the load. In this
work, we propose a general load modeling approach called load characteristics
modeling to capture the dynamics of the load. We integrate this proposed
modeling technique and leverage recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
based locomotion control to enable the robot to infer the dynamics of load
movement and interact with the load indirectly to stabilize it and realize the
sim-to-real deployment to verify its effectiveness in real scenarios. We
conduct extensive comparative simulation experiments to validate the
effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Results show that our
method outperforms other methods in sudden load resistance, load stabilizing
and locomotion with heavy load on rough terrain.

TL;DR: 本文研究机器人感知信息的扭曲及其对自主表征学习的影响，利用模拟两轮机器人展示了在简单环境中的感知空间扭曲及其结构化表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人自主导航依赖于传感器信息，但传感器往往不完美，会导致内在世界表征的扭曲。探索这种扭曲的性质及其对表征学习的影响，有助于理解具身认知和自主导航机制。

Method: 使用带距离传感器和指南针的模拟两轮机器人，在简单方形环境中进行随机探索，分析传感器数据以揭示感知空间的扭曲和其中的结构。

Result: 尽管感知空间存在扭曲，机器人仍能在其内部表征中自动形成与物理环境相关的结构，实现无显式空间信息的导航能力。

Conclusion: 机器人通过自身感知扭曲能够学习到结构化的环境表征，支持了具身认知和最小智能体模型中自主导航策略的理论基础。

Abstract: Autonomous agents, particularly in the field of robotics, rely on sensory
information to perceive and navigate their environment. However, these sensory
inputs are often imperfect, leading to distortions in the agent's internal
representation of the world. This paper investigates the nature of these
perceptual distortions and how they influence autonomous representation
learning using a minimal robotic system. We utilize a simulated two-wheeled
robot equipped with distance sensors and a compass, operating within a simple
square environment. Through analysis of the robot's sensor data during random
exploration, we demonstrate how a distorted perceptual space emerges. Despite
these distortions, we identify emergent structures within the perceptual space
that correlate with the physical environment, revealing how the robot
autonomously learns a structured representation for navigation without explicit
spatial information. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied
cognition, minimal agency, and the role of perception in self-generated
navigation strategies in artificial life.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROS系统架构复杂，技术门槛高，导致普通用户难以理解机器人状态和诊断错误，增加维护时间和系统停机率。

Abstract: As the robotics systems increasingly integrate into daily life, from smart
home assistants to the new-wave of industrial automation systems (Industry
4.0), there's an increasing need to bridge the gap between complex robotic
systems and everyday users. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible
framework often utilised in writing robot software, providing tools and
libraries for building complex robotic systems. However, ROS's distributed
architecture and technical messaging system create barriers for understanding
robot status and diagnosing errors. This gap can lead to extended maintenance
downtimes, as users with limited ROS knowledge may struggle to quickly diagnose
and resolve system issues. Moreover, this deficit in expertise often delays
proactive maintenance and troubleshooting, further increasing the frequency and
duration of system interruptions. ROS Help Desk provides intuitive error
explanations and debugging support, dynamically customized to users of varying
expertise levels. It features user-centric debugging tools that simplify error
diagnosis, implements proactive error detection capabilities to reduce
downtime, and integrates multimodal data processing for comprehensive system
state understanding across multi-sensor data (e.g., lidar, RGB). Testing
qualitatively and quantitatively with artificially induced errors demonstrates
the system's ability to proactively and accurately diagnose problems,
ultimately reducing maintenance time and fostering more effective human-robot
collaboration.

### [285] [Improving AEBS Validation Through Objective Intervention Classification Leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07872)
*Daniel Betschinske,Steven Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于预测差异原则（PDP）的规则分类方法，用于解决自动紧急制动系统（AEBS）安全验证中误报与真实报警区分的复杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AEBS的安全验证需要准确区分误报和真实报警，但开放式闭环重模拟中的场景参数不确定性和驾驶员干预导致分析复杂，传统人工作标记存在主观偏见。

Method: 基于预测差异原则，本文设计了一套规则分类方法，应用于简化的AEBS系统，结合人工作标记以提升分类的透明度和一致性。

Result: 该方法展示了其在关键优点、局限性及系统需求上的表现，证明了其对提高分类准确性和验证透明度的帮助。

Conclusion: 本文方法能够补充现有安全验证实践，推动AEBS验证框架的可靠性和复现性，未来将进一步优化规则集和拓展应用范围。

Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires
accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP)
system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by
comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from
open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -
is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and
the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is
frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments
of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing
biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach
leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.
Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,
limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings
suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the
transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall
validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work
adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for
refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the
potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for
more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数商业机器人未配备触觉皮肤，难以实现触摸感知，如接触定位，因此需要一种无需安装额外传感器的触摸感知方案。

Method: 基于机器人自身的关节传感器数据，采用数据驱动方法实现全身触觉感知和接触定位，无需增加额外传感器。

Result: 在Franka机器人臂上，接触定位误差约为8.0厘米；Spot四足机器人上误差约为7.2厘米，定位频率约为2000Hz，且无额外硬件需求。

Conclusion: UniTac有效实现了机器人全身触觉感知，具有高精度和高频率，能为人机交互研究提供现成的触觉感知工具，促进触觉传感的普及化。

Abstract: Robots can better interact with humans and unstructured environments through
touch sensing. However, most commercial robots are not equipped with tactile
skins, making it challenging to achieve even basic touch-sensing functions,
such as contact localization. We present UniTac, a data-driven whole-body
touch-sensing approach that uses only proprioceptive joint sensors and does not
require the installation of additional sensors. Our approach enables a robot
equipped solely with joint sensors to localize contacts. Our goal is to
democratize touch sensing and provide an off-the-shelf tool for HRI researchers
to provide their robots with touch-sensing capabilities. We validate our
approach on two platforms: the Franka robot arm and the Spot quadruped. On
Franka, we can localize contact to within 8.0 centimeters, and on Spot, we can
localize to within 7.2 centimeters at around 2,000 Hz on an RTX 3090 GPU
without adding any additional sensors to the robot. Project website:
