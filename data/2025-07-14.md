### [2] [Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Precision Agriculture: Multi-Response Consensus for Crop Disease Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08024)
*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ITU-R P.1411-12推荐中环境类型描述较为定性，缺乏自动化分类方法，影响传播模型的准确性。

Method: 采用机器学习技术对环境类型进行自动分类，优化分类准确率，生成覆盖加拿大的形态地图。

*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个评估文本生成图像模型的综合框架，针对模型是否准确遵循文本提示进行测试，并发现当前主流模型在生成简单的几何图形及其位置时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型和文本转图像模型发展迅速，但缺乏针对其性能和鲁棒性的系统评估，尤其是对遵守文本提示的能力缺乏研究。

Method: 作者设计了一个新的数据集，聚焦文本提示中的变化因素，通过GPT-4o生成描述作为基准，利用该描述生成图像后再次用GPT-4o描述生成图像，比较两次描述的差异以评估模型的遵守度。

Result: 评测包括三个Stable Diffusion变体和两个Janus变体，结果显示这些模型难以生成遵循简单二元变化（如几何形状及位置）的图像，并且生成图像与输入数据分布差异大。

Conclusion: 目前主流文本转图像模型在准确遵守文本提示生成符合预期的图像方面存在明显不足，有必要进一步提升其鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种数据驱动的LoRA权重初始化方法CNTLoRA，该方法通过将LoRA初始化转化为域迁移问题，利用预训练和微调激活之间的多重约束，计算出闭式权重估计，无需训练过程，支持可变秩初始化，有效提升了微调收敛速度和最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重通常随机初始化且秩固定，存在收敛慢和性能受限的问题，作者希望通过更合理的初始化方法提升LoRA微调效率和效果。

Method: 将LoRA权重初始化视为预训练与微调激活之间的域迁移问题，提出多重约束并重构以获得依赖预训练权重和微调激活向量的闭式权重估计，无需训练即完成初始化，并允许变量秩分解，赋予更灵活的权重结构。

Result: 在图像生成、图像分类和图像理解等下游任务中，CNTLoRA在定量和定性指标上均优于标准和其他数据驱动的初始化方法，表现出更快收敛和更好性能。

Conclusion: 通过合理的初始化方式，CNTLoRA有效提升了LoRA微调的效率与表现，相关设计决策经过广泛分析和消融验证，提供了提升收敛速度和性能的优化方案。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于极限学习机自编码器（ELM-AE）和区间二型模糊逻辑的新型混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机的主动图像分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多层极限学习机在自然信号分类方面取得了成功，但在无人机主动图像分类任务中仍存在提升空间，故提出融合模糊逻辑的混合模型以提升分类性能。

Method: 设计了一个分两阶段的层次式ELM学习框架：第一阶段通过叠加多个ELM-AE进行无监督的多层特征提取；第二阶段采用一种改进的简化区间二型模糊ELM（SIT2-FELM）进行有监督特征分类，结合快速输出缩减层。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准和无人机实际任务中，该方法表现出比传统ML-ELM、ML-FELM及ELM更优越的分类效率和准确率。

Conclusion: 所提混合多层极限学习机有效提升了图像分类性能，尤其在无人机应用中展示了强大的实用价值和优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,

and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于扩散模型的图像去噪算法在噪声类型非高斯分布情况下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前去噪算法基于高斯噪声的数学性质设计，实际中噪声可能非高斯，研究算法在非高斯噪声下的表现有助于理解其鲁棒性。

Method: 使用原算法不作修改，直接替换不同类型噪声（均匀分布、Beta分布、双高斯噪声）进行实验，并在低算力、小图像尺寸下观察结果。

Result: 算法在非高斯噪声下的性能表现被记录，展示与高斯噪声情况不同的表现。

Conclusion: 算法设计基于高斯噪声，其性能在非高斯噪声环境中可能下降，未来需探索适应不同噪声分布的改进方案。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [9] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动建筑高度估计方法，利用单幅超高分辨率COSMO-SkyMed合成孔径雷达影像，通过目标检测和回归技术实现建筑高度预测，在多洲多城数据集上验证了模型的泛化能力，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计建筑高度对城市管理和规划等应用至关重要，但现有方法在不同城市和地理区域的泛化能力有限，因此需要一种鲁棒性强的自动化估计方法。

Method: 采用基于深度学习的目标检测结合回归框架，在单幅超高分辨率COSMO-SkyMed SAR影像上进行建筑物边界框检测，随后进行高度估计。模型在包含欧洲、北美、南美和亚洲共八个城市的大规模多样化数据集上训练和交叉验证，重点评估模型的跨城市及跨大陆泛化性能。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现最佳，平均绝对误差约为一层楼高度（慕尼黑为2.20米），显著优于同类最新方法。在亚洲等大陆由于城市结构差异表现有所下降，但仍展现较强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于深度学习的单幅VHR SAR影像建筑高度估计方法展现出强大的跨城市和跨大陆迁移学习能力，为城市高度估计提供了一种高效、准确且具有广泛适用性的技术方案。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了可提前警报近距离障碍物的系统，有效辅助视障人士安全通行。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯点注册的新框架RegGS，用于解决稀疏无姿态视图下的场景重建问题，实现精确相机姿态估计和高质量新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯点方法在稀疏视图下受限于先验知识，优化效果差，且基于前馈网络的高斯方法难以融合更多输入视图。

Method: 设计了RegGS框架，采用熵正则化Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输Mixture 2-Wasserstein距离，作为高斯混合模型在Sim(3)空间中的对齐度量，结合光度一致性和深度几何，进行粗到细的3D高斯注册与相机姿态估计。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真局部高斯对齐，提升了相机姿态估计的精准度和新视角合成质量。

Conclusion: RegGS有效解决了稀疏无姿态视图的3D高斯重建难题，具备高精度姿态恢复和新视角合成功能，展示了优越的应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于从单目视频重建动态人-物体交互的新框架，该框架通过遮挡补全和时间上下文整合，有效应对遮挡和时间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3D重建方法假设对象静止或完全可见，面对动态且相互遮挡的场景时表现不佳，急需一种能处理遮挡和时间连贯性的解决方案。

Method: 该方法利用遮挡补全推断被遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文实现序列一致性，采用无模板策略自适应不同条件，通过3D高斯点法进行重建。

Result: 在复杂的单目视频中，所提方法在处理遮挡和保持时间稳定性方面表现优越，重建精度明显优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了动态场景中人-物体交互的3D重建质量，为面对复杂遮挡和动态变化的重建任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗样本认证方法有限，难以同时保证模型的适应性和准确性。

Method: 将引导去噪扩散模型重新解释为自适应高斯差分隐私机制序列，通过隐私过滤器组合分析端到端鲁棒性，从而实现认证。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，所提出的方法在特定策略下提升了模型的认证准确率和标准准确率。

Conclusion: 自适应扩散去噪平滑方法有效增强了视觉模型面对对抗样本的鲁棒性，且兼顾了准确性和认证能力。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分辨率鲁棒的医学图像分割模型HNOSeg-XS，利用Hartley变换的傅里叶神经算子实现高效、快速且内存友好的多尺度分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卷积神经网络和变换器在医学图像分割中因计算复杂度和内存需求大，3D模型层数受限，导致分辨率提升困难与性能受限。

Method: 通过傅里叶神经算子建模图像分割的可学习偏微分方程，替换傅里叶变换为Hartley变换，在频域重构模型，设计具有零样本超分辨率特性的HNOSeg-XS架构。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS架构高效且参数轻量，解决了高分辨率医学图像的分割难题，展现出卓越的性能与实用价值。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier

Result: 在合成与真实生物医学数据集上，SurfDist以更加紧凑的参数化方式在形状类似斑点的实例分割任务中优于StarDist-3D。

Conclusion: SurfDist证明了在实例分割中联合学习可解释的实例表面模型与实例归属的有效性，具备推广潜力。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization

significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动方式是神经和肌肉骨骼健康的直接反映，但临床中缺少方便、有效的运动测量手段，限制了生物力学数据的广泛应用。

Method: 开发了包括云端智能手机应用和新型生物力学建模算法的PBL系统，用于采集和分析运动数据，并通过大量临床数据进行验证。

Result: PBL实现了关节角度误差控制在3度以内，运动指标可靠且能敏感反映临床差异，且对手术干预的响应比患者报告结果更敏感。

Conclusion: 基于手持智能手机视频的PBL系统提供了一种低成本、易用且临床验证的全身运动测量方法，具有广泛应用于运动障碍监测的潜力。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

TL;DR: 提出了结合结构先验与证据学习理论的CR-Net，用于解决SAR目标检测中分辨率差异引起的域适应问题，实现跨分辨率的可靠目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SAR分辨率的提升，散射特征差异加大，导致目标检测模型的泛化能力下降，现有域适应技术因特征盲适应和语义传播不可靠而性能受限。

Method: 提出CR-Net，融合结构诱导的分层特征适应（SHFA）模块和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA）模块，分别实现结构相关性建立与结构感知特征适应，以及利用可靠邻接集进行语义对齐和判别能力增强。

Result: 在不同分辨率数据集上的实验表明，CR-Net通过保持域内结构和提升判别能力，显著改善了跨分辨率适应，达到了当前最优性能。

Conclusion: CR-Net有效解决了SAR目标检测中的跨分辨率域适应难题，增强了模型的可解释性和判别能力，实现了更可靠的目标检测效果。 

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过有效分离和优化不同粒度运动，显著改善了动画头像生成中的运动伪影，提升了生成视频的质量和真实感。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Method: 引入了一种基于可解释性的剪枝框架，通过保留各层中最相关的部分，实现有针对性的模型压缩，保持模型的临床意义表示。

Result: 在多个医疗图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率，同时准确率仅有极小的下降。

Conclusion: 该可解释性指导的剪枝方法推动了轻量级、可解释模型在医疗领域的实际部署。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Motivation: 现有的生成式概念瓶颈模型为了补偿概念未捕获的信息，依赖辅助视觉线索，降低了解释性和组合性。

Method: 提出了CoCo-Bot，一种后验的复合概念瓶颈生成模型，利用基于扩散的能量函数实现仅通过显式概念传递所有信息，并支持概念的组合与否定等干预操作。

Result: 在基于CelebA-HQ预训练的StyleGAN2上进行实验，CoCo-Bot提升了概念级控制能力和可解释性，同时保持了竞争性的视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，实现了更好的概念可控生成，兼顾了生成质量和模型的可解释性与灵活控制。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Conclusion: 结合多范围特征和对抗生成技术的MRAG有助于提升深度隐写的安全性和隐蔽性，未来可推动隐写技术在实际中的应用。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为循环上下文验证（CCV）的新框架，通过自我验证预测结果来提升基于上下文学习(ICL)的医学图像分割性能，解决了在标注数据稀缺情况下上下文对齐困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学图像分割应用中，使用单一模型进行多对象多模态图像分割的ICL方法表现依赖于查询图像与上下文图像-掩码对的匹配，且临床中标注数据稀缺，难以选择最佳上下文对和对基础ICL模型进行微调。

Method: 提出CCV框架，通过循环管线，先对查询图像生成分割掩码，再交换查询与上下文对的角色，预测原上下文图像的掩码，以此验证初始分割的准确性，并引入查询特定提示词调整查询图像以提高预测准确性和上下文对齐度。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集和两个ICL基础模型上进行评估，CCV在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCV显著提升了基于ICL的医学图像分割的鲁棒性和通用性，是一种有效的医学图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

a wide range of downstream computer vision tasks. This survey presents a
comprehensive review of video restoration and enhancement techniques with a
particular focus on unsupervised approaches. We begin by outlining the most
common video degradations and their underlying causes, followed by a review of

unsupervised video restoration and enhancement, and discuss the role of paired
synthetic datasets in enabling objective evaluation. Finally, we identify key
challenges and outline promising directions for future research in this field.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的低光照增强与理解方法（GEFU），利用预训练扩散模型和语义一致的无监督微调技术，提升低光照图像的质量及其在分类、检测、语义分割等任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的低光照增强和视觉理解方法分开处理，增强方法依赖物理和几何先验，泛化能力差；视觉理解受限于标注数据稀缺，缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 利用预训练扩散生成模型实现零样本泛化性能；提出语义一致无监督微调（SCUF），包括照明感知图像提示和循环注意力适配器；通过标题和反射一致性学习高级语义和图像空间语义。

Conclusion: GEFU范式有效连接低光增强和理解，提升了泛化能力和可扩展性，推动了低光照视觉任务的性能提升。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations

extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法在保持主体一致性的同时往往牺牲了布局和姿势的多样性，限制了视觉故事表达。

Method: CoDi采用基于扩散模型的两阶段策略：早期利用最优传输进行身份特征的姿态感知转移（IT阶段），后期通过身份细化（IR阶段）选取最显著的身份特征以优化细节。

Result: 在主体一致性、姿势多样性和文本提示忠实度上，CoDi均优于现有方法，视觉效果更佳，性能更强。

Conclusion: CoDi成功实现了文本到图像生成中主体的一致性与姿势多样性的平衡，提升了视觉表现力和性能，且代码已开源。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

TL;DR: PanMatch是一种多功能基础模型，可统一处理立体匹配、光流和特征匹配任务，实现单一权重跨任务位移估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有匹配方法多依赖任务专用架构和域专用微调，缺乏通用性和强泛化能力。

Method: 采用统一的2D位移估计框架，设计稳健的特征提取器并利用大规模视觉模型的通用特征，结合近180万跨域数据进行预训练。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，并在任务专用基准测试中表现相当，同时在异常场景如雨天和卫星图像中展现出零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过统一模型和多域预训练，PanMatch实现了多任务匹配的鲁棒性和零样本跨域泛化，有效解决了匹配任务的多样性和泛化挑战。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了语义哈希中心（SHC）方法，通过结合数据相关的语义关系生成哈希中心，提升了图像检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点式深度哈希方法生成的哈希中心忽略了类别间的语义关系，导致检索性能下降。

Method: 设计三阶段框架：1）使用数据相关的分类网络计算语义相似度；2）优化生成保持语义相关性且具备最小距离的哈希中心；3）训练深度哈希网络将图像转换为二进制哈希码。

Result: 在多个公开大规模数据集上的图像检索任务中，SHC方法在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别提升了7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: 通过引入语义哈希中心并设计相应优化算法，SHC显著提高了深度哈希图像检索的性能，证明了考虑语义关系的重要性。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉-语言模型的多模态互导条件提示学习方法MuGCP，以提升对新类别的泛化能力和跨模态对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法在对未知类别的类嵌入分布建模不足，导致泛化能力差；且跨模态对齐多限于输出层，限制了多模态嵌入空间的拓扑一致性。

Method: 提出MuGCP方法，利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示(SCP)，引入注意力互导模块(AMG)实现视觉与语义信息交互，并设计多提示融合机制(MPF)整合多种提示提升类嵌入和实例知识建模。

Result: MuGCP在14个数据集上优于现有最先进方法，表现出更好的多模态任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过条件提示生成和互导机制，MuGCP有效提升了视觉-语言模型在多模态任务中的对新类泛化和对齐能力，是一种有效的提示学习新范式。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的重建技术将场景视为整体，难以从部分观测中识别和完整重建对象，机器人难以具备类似人类的认知能力。

Method: 提出空间对比学习，通过多视角跟踪实例光栅化增强语义监督，并引入现场生成方法利用观测和几何线索指导3D生成模型完成实例重建。

Result: 在复杂的真实和合成场景中，实现了更优的实例分解精度和几何准确且视觉完整的对象重建。

Conclusion: InstaScene有效提升了复杂场景中实例的分解和完整重建能力，为机器人3D感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的区域自适应潜在上采样（RALU）方法，通过混合分辨率采样加速扩散变换器的推理，显著提升计算效率且几乎不损失图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前扩散变换器计算量大，限制了实际应用，加速方法多聚焦时间维度，缺少空间维度的高效加速手段。

Method: 提出RALU框架，采用三阶段混合分辨率采样：低分辨率降噪捕捉全局语义，区域自适应高分辨率上采样修复易出错区域，最后全分辨率细节精炼；同时引入噪声时间重调节稳定分辨率转换。

Result: 在FLUX和Stable Diffusion 3上分别实现最高7倍和3倍推理加速，图像质量几乎无损；且RALU可与时间维度加速方法结合，进一步降低延迟。

Conclusion: RALU有效提升了扩散变换器的推理速度和实用性，拓展了空间维度加速方法，兼容现有技术，为高效图像生成提供新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Result: 该方法在多视角修补的几何准确性和外观一致性方面均优于现有方法，能够在复杂场景中产生更真实且感知一致的修补结果。

Conclusion: 引入参考视图和基于相似度的权重调整，有效解决了3D场景修补中视角不一致的问题，提高了修补区域的真实感和一致性。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: 通过结构归纳偏置，本文为复杂文档类型提供了一种统一高效的识别框架，对未来文档基础模型设计有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Motivation: 当前临床医学图像分割面临依赖完整多模态输入、泛化能力有限以及任务专一性强的挑战，亟需一个通用且鲁棒的基础模型。

Method: 采用灵活的合成模态训练和零图像策略代替缺失模态，不依赖显式合成网络，同时设计统一架构支持多病理分割，无需针对不同疾病微调。

Result: F3-Net在BraTS 2021、BraTS 2024及ISLES 2022数据集上均表现优异，DSC分别达到0.94、0.82、0.94和0.79，优于传统CNN和Transformer模型。

Conclusion: F3-Net作为一个多任务多模态鲁棒的基础模型，有效解决了实际临床应用中的多模态缺失与任务单一问题，是深度学习向临床应用桥梁的重要进展。

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a
versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research
and practical clinical deployment.

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向遮挡人物重新识别的特征净化学习方法OGFR，通过基于强化学习的知识蒸馏，有效处理多样遮挡场景和特征污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以应对训练中未见的多样遮挡情况，且整体图像特征易被噪声污染，影响重识别性能。

Method: 设计了基于可学习遮挡模式嵌入的视觉变换器，结合强化学习代理在整体分支对低质量补丁进行替换净化，利用知识蒸馏将净化的整体特征传递至遮挡分支，实现稳健特征表现。

Result: 实验表明，OGFR方法能有效适应多样遮挡，提升遮挡人物重识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OGFR通过遮挡感知机制与强化知识蒸馏，成功解决了遮挡重识别中多样遮挡与特征污染问题，具备较强的实用价值和推广潜力。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了RadiomicsRetrieval，一种基于3D体积数据的医学图像检索框架，结合了手工辐射组学特征和深度学习图像嵌入，提高了检索的灵活性和精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像检索方法多为二维且要求完全标注的查询，限制了临床应用的灵活性。需要一种支持三维图像、且能在肿瘤层面灵活查询的新方法。

Method: 利用可提示分割模型(SAM)获取肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习将其与相同肿瘤的手工辐射组学特征对齐，结合解剖位置嵌入(APE)，实现基于形状、位置或部分特征集的灵活查询。

Result: 在肺部CT和脑部MRI公开数据集上实验，辐射组学特征显著提升检索特异性，APE提供了关键的解剖位置上下文，实现了仅需少量用户提示即可有效检索的结果。

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval框架增强了医学图像检索的适用性和灵活性，支持多种临床场景和查询方式，有助于诊断、治疗规划及大规模医学影像库的研究应用。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at
https://github.com/nainye/RadiomicsRetrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出利用强化学习优化Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)的记忆更新策略，通过将记忆控制视为序列决策问题，显著提升了视频目标跟踪的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要通过手工设计规则来更新SAM 2的记忆库，难以有效应对干扰物、遮挡和目标运动等复杂情况，限制了模型性能的提升。

Method: 将记忆控制问题建模为序列决策，利用强化学习训练独立智能体优化每个视频的记忆更新策略，替代传统的手工规则。

Result: 在过拟合设置下，该方法比原始SAM 2的提升效果超过传统启发式方法三倍以上。

Conclusion: 强化学习显著挖掘了SAM 2记忆库的潜力，是优于手工规则的记忆更新控制方法，为视觉目标跟踪提供了强有力的新方向。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

### [48] [Image Translation with Kernel Prediction Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08554)
*Cristina Mata,Michael S. Ryoo,Henrik Turbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像翻译方法DA-KPN，用于解决语义分割中合成数据与真实数据领域差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的非配对图像翻译方法无法保证语义匹配，导致语义分割性能下降。

Method: 提出Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN)，通过像素级输入变换参数估计和多尺度判别器实现语义匹配和真实感变换。

Result: DA-KPN在有限真实图像标签的情况下，语义分割syn2real基准测试中优于以前的GAN方法，在人脸解析任务中性能相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN有效保证了语义匹配，提升了合成到真实领域的图像翻译质量，从而改善语义分割性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于体素的3D场景补全方法限制了类级别信息的利用，而类级别信息对于提升补全结果的细粒度至关重要。

Method: 提出了DISC，即双流分离实例和场景上下文的方法，采用类级别查询替代体素查询，并设计专门的解码模块促进类级别信息高效流动。

Result: DISC在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360数据集上分别取得17.35和20.55的mIoU，超越了多帧SOTA方法，并在实例类别性能上显著提升。

Conclusion: DISC有效利用类级别信息，提升了3D语义场景补全的精度及细粒度表现，优于当前主流方法，具备较高应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is
available at https://github.com/Enyu-Liu/DISC.

achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D

spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对视觉语言模型在时序渐进式分布变化下表现下降的问题，提出了一种贝叶斯适应框架BayesTTA，有效提升了模型的适应能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的连续测试时适应方法针对的是突发且剧烈的分布变化，忽视了实际场景中数据分布的渐进式变化，导致记忆限制、置信度不可靠和表示不匹配等问题。

Method: 提出BayesTTA框架，基于贝叶斯方法增量估计类条件高斯混合分布，利用统计假设检验动态选择协方差结构，并通过高斯判别分析实现校准推断；利用自监督的归一化层自适应，动态对齐视觉表示。

Result: 在四个时序演变数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上进行了全面评测，实验结果表明BayesTTA显著优于现有最先进方法，并在保持效率的同时实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时序渐进分布变化下的持续测试适应问题，保证了预测的时序一致性和视觉表示的动态对齐，提升了VLMs的适应性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 提高手写文档中关键信息抽取的效率，减少人工标注工作量。

Method: 采用DAN模型，利用两种不同的自动标注策略（标准化标注和文书标注）对含有相同图像但不同标注的数据集进行微调训练。

Result: 标准化标注在日期和出生地等可标准化字段上效果更好，文书标注在姓名和姓氏等不可标准化字段上表现更优。

Conclusion: 针对不同类型字段选择合适的标注策略能够有效提升手写文档信息提取的性能和效率。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,

automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

TL;DR: 提出基于BEV特征时序融合的3D感知方法OnlineBEV，实现动态对齐与显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视角BEV 3D感知在时序特征融合时，动态物体导致BEV特征时空变化，限制了融合效果提升。

Method: OnlineBEV通过递归结构结合更多时序BEV特征，采用MBFNet提取运动特征动态对齐历史和当前BEV，再通过时序一致性学习损失显式优化对齐效果。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上，OnlineBEV以63.9% NDS显著超越当前最佳相机3D检测方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV有效解决了时序BEV特征动态对齐问题，实现了多帧特征融合的性能突破，达成了相机3D检测的新最优。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Conclusion: DatasetAgent有效提升了基于真实世界图像的自动数据集构建效率，适用于各种任务，展示了多智能体协作系统在数据集构建领域的潜力。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 介绍ByDeWay，一种无需训练的多模态大语言模型性能提升框架，通过分层深度提示增强空间推理和定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在空间推理和视觉定位方面存在不足，且修改模型参数复杂。

Method: 提出分层深度提示（LDP），利用单目深度估计将场景分为不同距离层级，生成对应区域的描述性文本并附加到图像问答提示中，无需修改模型。

Result: 在消除幻觉敏感（POPE）和推理密集（GQA）基准测试中，ByDeWay提升了多种多模态模型的性能，效果显著且一致。

Conclusion: ByDeWay方法轻量级、模块化、适用于黑盒模型，证明了深度感知提示在零训练条件下提升多模态模型空间理解和减少幻觉的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MoSAiC框架，用于多模态卫星影像的对比学习，解决高类间相似度和多标签场景下的表征学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球系统观测中的多模态卫星影像具有自然对齐视图，但高类间相似度、场景复杂和模糊边界增加了表征学习难度，现有对比学习方法缺乏跨模态多标签对齐机制。

Method: 提出MoSAiC框架，联合优化模态内和模态间的对比学习，结合多标签监督的对比损失，实现更细粒度语义区分和更鲁棒的表征学习。

Result: 在BigEarthNet V2.0和Sent12MS两个基准数据集上，MoSAiC在准确率、聚类一致性和低标签、高类别重叠场景下的泛化能力均优于全监督和自监督基线。

Conclusion: MoSAiC有效提升了多模态卫星影像的表征学习能力，特别适用于标注资源有限且类别重叠严重的地球系统观测任务。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MRI肌肉图像分割方法计算成本高，需要大量训练数据，对小肌肉分割准确率低，且CNN方法泛化和解释能力有限。

Method: 提出结合关键点选择与Lucas-Kanade光流的无训练分割方法，通过关键点跟踪实现肌肉结构识别。

Result: 该方法实现了0.6到0.7的平均Dice相似系数，表现与先进CNN模型相当，同时显著降低了计算需求并增强了结果可解释性。

Conclusion: 该无训练分割框架为肌肉MRI分割提供了一种高效、可扩展且解释性强的替代方案，适用于临床和科研场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

TL;DR: 提出了轻量级CLIP架构的嵌入式图像描述评价指标L-CLIPScore，通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩模型，并设计多模态相似性调节损失实现知识蒸馏，提升效率且保持多模态对齐能力。实验证明L-CLIPScore在评价和训练图像描述模型时效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型体积大，计算资源消耗高，限制了图像描述质量评价指标的效率和实际应用。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解技术压缩CLIP编码器权重和词嵌入矩阵，设计多模态相似性调节（SR）损失来完成蒸馏，增强图像和文本嵌入的对齐能力，同时减少参数和计算资源消耗。

Result: 压缩和蒸馏后的L-CLIP在保持与原始CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力的同时，显著降低计算资源和运行时间。使用L-CLIPScore评价描述质量效果良好，且可与n-gram指标结合用于训练，避免单独使用时训练失败。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore是一种高效且有效的图像描述评价指标，对提升图像描述模型训练和评价具有实际价值，建议与传统指标结合使用以获得更稳定的训练效果。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于稀疏高斯过程的注意力多实例学习框架SGPMIL，用于在数字病理图像中实现不确定性量化和高质量实例级预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性注意力多实例学习方法虽然在整体标签预测上效果良好，但忽略了实例相关性的不确定性，导致实例级解释力不足。

Method: 提出SGPMIL，基于稀疏高斯过程模型对注意力分数建模为后验分布，实现不确定性评估，并引入特征缩放提升训练速度和实例性能。

Result: SGPMIL在多个数字病理数据集上实现了具有竞争力的包级性能，同时显著提升了实例级预测的质量和解释性。

Conclusion: 通过引入概率化注意力机制和特征缩放，SGPMIL增强了多实例学习模型对实例不确定性的刻画，提升了解释性和性能，适用于数字病理等大规模图像分析任务。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD作为首个高分辨率多摄像机真实环形路场景车辆追踪数据集，有助于推动智能交通系统相关研究与实际应用发展。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，利用集成学习增强模型表现。

Method: 基于频谱总变分(STV)特征设计弱学习器，利用这些低相关特征集成学习。

Result: 在457例CT和PET配对扫描中，STV方法AUC达0.87，优于神经网络和Radiomics方法。

Conclusion: STV特征在骨转移预测任务中表现优异，细尺度STV特征对预测高摄取尤为关键。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Conclusion: HieraRS及TransLU框架有效解决了多粒度层级分类及跨领域异构层级迁移问题，提升了土地覆盖与利用分类模型的实用性和推广能力。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT为交通系统数字孪生提供了灵活且具上下文感知的基础设施建模方案，具备良好的扩展性和隐私保护，推动了交通管理智能化。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Birkhoff的无数据压缩算法，专门针对Segment Anything Model (SAM) 及其变体，能够在无微调数据的情况下实现高效压缩且性能损失小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM及其变体广泛应用于多种场景，但其模型体积大，压缩需求迫切。传统压缩方法存在适用性和性能损失等问题，因此需要一种新的高效且通用的压缩方法。

Method: 提出Birkhoff压缩算法，核心为Hyper-Compression，将高维参数向量转换为低维标量，设计了HyperLinear线性层融合解压和矩阵乘法，加速推理。

Result: Birkhoff在18个SAM模型和三个数据集上表现优异，压缩比最高达5.17倍，性能下降不足1%，且所有模型压缩时间均在60秒内完成。

Conclusion: Birkhoff算法兼具通用性、快速性和压缩效果，能够有效压缩SAM模型，为实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CoPart，一种基于部件感知的3D扩散生成框架，通过分解3D对象为多个部件潜变量，实现复杂几何体的高质量生成及细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成方法存在单一潜变量表达复杂结构能力不足、整体编码忽略部件间关系以及全局条件控制能力薄弱等问题。

Method: 提出CoPart框架，将3D物体分解为上下文相关的部件潜变量，并设计互助引导策略微调预训练扩散模型，以实现部件级联合降噪和建模。构建大规模3D部件数据集Partverse，支持模型训练。

Result: 实验结果显示CoPart在部件级编辑、关节式物体生成及场景组合方面表现优越，具备前所未有的细粒度控制能力。

Conclusion: CoPart通过部件分解和互助引导策略，有效提升了3D生成的细节表现和控制能力，为复杂多部件3D对象生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于压缩光场标记（CLiFTs）的神经渲染方法，能够在保留丰富场景信息的同时，提高渲染效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经渲染方法在渲染效率和场景表示紧凑性方面存在挑战，特别是在需兼顾渲染质量和计算资源限制时。

Method: 利用多视角编码器和潜在空间K-means聚类，提取和压缩光场信息为压缩光场标记（CLiFTs），通过可调节数量的标记实现灵活、高效的视图合成。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上的实验表明，该方法在大幅减少数据量的同时，保持了高质量渲染效果，整体渲染评分最高，并可在数据大小、渲染质量和速度间进行平衡。

Conclusion: CLiFTs方法有效解决了神经渲染中的数据冗余和计算效率问题，为灵活高效的三维视图合成提供了新的思路。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Lumos-1，一种基于自回归大语言模型架构的视频生成器，通过改进RoPE机制和引入AR-DF策略，有效解决时空建模和训练效率问题，实验证明其性能优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成模型要么偏离标准大语言模型架构，要么依赖大型文本编码器，或存在高延迟，迫切需要一种保留标准LLM架构且高效的视频生成方法。

Method: 提出MM-RoPE结合多频率和3D位置编码改善时空相关建模，设计遵守帧内双向和帧间因果依赖的令牌依赖策略，并引入AR-DF通过时序遮罩策略缓解因空间冗余导致的帧间损失不均衡问题。

Result: 在仅使用48 GPUs预训练的条件下，Lumos-1在多个视频生成基准数据集（GenEval、VBench-I2V、VBench-T2V）上达到了与先进模型EMU3等齐平的性能。

Conclusion: Lumos-1成功实现了在标准LLM架构基础上高效且高质量的自回归视频生成，展示了其在时空建模和训练效率上的优势，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于提示的文本转语音模型的微调方法，通过主成分分析利用模型生成结果中的不可控变化，提取潜在特征作为新标签进行二次微调，提高了语音合成的可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的文本转语音模型虽然用户友好，但控制能力受限于训练时暴露的声学特征，同时输入的灵活性导致生成结果存在不可控的变化。

Method: 利用主成分分析对大量合成样本进行分析，提取潜在特征作为新的控制标签，对模型进行二次微调以减少不可控变化并增强控制力。

Result: 该方法在两个使用冰岛语表达性语音语料库训练的模型（有情感披露和无情感披露）上进行评估，特别是在无情感披露模型上，提取的连续和离散特征显著提升了模型的可控性。

Conclusion: 通过利用不可控的输出变化提取潜在特征进行微调，能够有效提升基于提示的文本转语音模型的控制能力，改善合成语音的可控度。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional

diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question

such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as

TL;DR: 本文通过对200万条实际对话的实证分析，发现大语言模型的越狱攻击复杂度并不高且相对稳定，辅助系统的安全性有所提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛部署，理解越狱策略的复杂性和演变对于人工智能安全至关重要。

Method: 基于来自多个平台的越狱社区和通用聊天机器人的海量对话数据，采用概率测度、词汇多样性、压缩率和认知负荷等多种复杂度指标进行量化分析，并通过时间序列分析观察复杂度和毒性变化。

Result: 越狱攻击的复杂度与正常对话无显著差异，且在不同用户群体中呈现稳定趋势。助理回复的毒性有所下降，表明安全机制在改进。复杂度分布不符合理查德定律，暗示越狱开发存在自然限制。

Conclusion: 越狱攻击与防御并非处于持续升级的军备竞赛，安全提升受限于人类创造力，而防御手段持续进步。学术界越狱技术披露存在信息风险，复杂度更高的攻击可能打破现有平衡，造成防御响应前的广泛危害。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

Motivation: 评估FinGPT在实际金融应用中的能力与局限，为未来研究提供基准。

Method: 利用金融专用数据集测试FinGPT在情感分析、文本分类、命名实体识别、金融问答、文本摘要和股价预测六大任务上的表现。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现强劲，接近GPT-4水平；但在推理和生成任务中表现不足，存在数值准确性和复杂推理的明显差距。

Conclusion: FinGPT适合结构化金融任务，但尚非综合解决方案，未来需改进模型架构和进行领域优化。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

TL;DR: 本文综述了近年来机械可解释性领域的发现，提出大型语言模型（LLMs）具有类似人类理解的内部结构，并提出了机器理解的三层理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统观点认为LLMs仅依赖表面统计的看法，探讨LLMs是否具备更深层次的理解能力。

Method: 提出机器理解的三层次模型：概念理解（在潜在空间形成特征方向），世界状态理解（动态追踪事实联系），原则性理解（发现事实间的内在连接电路）。

Result: LLMs展现出不同层面的理解能力，但其内部认知结构与人类不同，存在“平行机制”现象。

Conclusion: LLMs确实表现出理解的形式，研究焦点应从是否理解转向如何工作其独特的认知机制。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Motivation: 迭代文本生成中模型难以有效识别并纠正自身错误的问题。

Result: 通过有针对性的再掩码和精细化，模型能显著改善生成结果。

Conclusion: R3框架简单且优雅，无需额外训练即可提升预训练掩码文本扩散模型的自我纠错能力和最终文本质量。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在招聘简历筛选中是否表现出稳定信号，及其与人类专家的对比。

Method: 利用受控数据集测试三种大型语言模型（Claude、GPT和Gemini）在不同公司背景下的评估表现，并与三位人类招聘专家比较，通过方差分析和配对t检验分析差异。

Result: 发现四种LLM条件下存在显著均值差异，LLM与人类评估结果之间差异显著（p<0.01）；GPT对公司背景适应性最强，Gemini部分适应，Claude最低；所有LLM与人类评分存在显著不同的判断模式。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在简历筛选中可提供可解释的模式，但其评估结果与人类专家存在较大差异，需谨慎用于自动化招聘系统。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

Method: 提出ETTA方法，利用线性变换识别并削弱嵌入空间中的毒性敏感维度，绕过模型拒绝行为，且无需微调模型或访问训练数据。

Result: ETTA在五个开源大语言模型上评测，攻击成功率平均达88.61%，超出最佳基线11.34%，在安全增强模型上仍达77.39%，表现优异。

Conclusion: ETTA揭示了当前安全对齐策略的嵌入空间漏洞，强调需发展面向嵌入空间的防御机制，提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了七种主流大型语言模型的政治倾向，发现它们普遍表现出自由主义价值观的优先偏好，尤其是关怀和公正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究显示大型语言模型在伦理和政治回应中表现出一致的自由主义倾向，但其成因和影响尚不明晰。本文旨在深入探讨这一现象的内在原因及其可能含义。

Method: 采用多种方法，包括道德基础理论、已验证的政治意识形态量表及新的政治争议指数，对七个主要LLM进行系统评估。此外，比较基础模型与微调模型的差异以分析微调影响。

Result: 大多数模型优先体现自由主义价值，特别是关怀与公正。该倾向源于自由主义训练语料、基于人类反馈的强化学习、学术伦理话语中的自由主义框架主导以及安全驱动的微调。微调普遍提升了自由主义倾向。

Conclusion: 自由主义倾向非程序错误或开发者偏好，而是民主权利导向语料训练的自然结果。该倾向反映了一种类似"无知之幕"的道德立场，可能为集体推理提供新的视角，有助于深化对民主话语的理解。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

### [82] [Better Together: Quantifying the Benefits of AI-Assisted Recruitment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08029)
*Ada Aka,Emil Palikot,Ali Ansari,Nima Yazdani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过实验比较了传统招聘流程与AI辅助招聘流程对初级开发者职位的影响，发现AI辅助流程显著提高了候选人通过率及后续就业率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工智能在招聘中的应用日益广泛，但其对招聘效率和候选人筛选影响的实证量化研究仍有限，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 随机分配3.7万名候选人进入传统招聘流程或AI辅助招聘流程。AI流程包括AI驱动的结构化视频面试，随后是人类评估。最终人类面试官对两组候选人进行盲审，确保无偏见。

Result: AI辅助流程中54%的候选人通过最终面试，传统流程为34%，两者相差20个百分点。五个月后，AI组候选人找到新工作的比例为23%，高于传统组18%，差距约5.9个百分点。AI倾向选择较年轻、经验较少、资历较低的应聘者。

Conclusion: AI技术在招聘决策中能够有效提升筛选效率和候选人后续就业率，但也带来选拔标准和候选人特征的变化，需进一步理解其潜在影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究分析了2022至2025年间生成式AI模型在医疗图像解读和临床问答中的免责声明使用情况，发现免责声明频率显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于生成式AI模型在医疗领域的应用越来越广泛，但其回答常含不准确内容，研究旨在评估模型输出中免责声明的存在情况，保障使用安全。

Method: 采用500张乳腺X线片、胸片、皮肤科图像和医疗问答，从多个年份的不同模型输出中筛查免责声明语句的出现率。

Result: 免责声明在大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的输出中显著减少，2025年免责声明出现率降至约1%，大多数模型已无免责声明。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力提升，免责声明的缺失可能增加误导风险，应针对不同临床场景强化免责声明的设计和应用，保障患者安全。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了五个小型语言模型(SLMs)在心理健康理解任务中的表现，发现SLMs在二分类任务中的表现仅比大型语言模型(LLMs)低2%，在多分类任务中表现下降较大，少量示例学习显著提升了SLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于SLMs作为隐私保护工具在敏感应用中的潜力，本文探讨了它们与LLMs在心理健康理解能力上的差异和优势。

Method: 通过零样本和少样本学习范式，比较了五个先进SLMs与三个LLMs在六个心理健康理解分类任务上的性能。

Result: SLMs在二分类任务中表现接近LLMs（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），多分类严重程度任务中表现下降均超过30%。少样本学习使SLMs性能提升最多达14.6%。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康分析中具备有效的隐私保护能力和良好的适应性，尤其在少样本情况下表现优异，适合作为可扩展的心理健康筛查工具。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅凭语言模型本身缺乏相关上下文信息，导致回答质量较差或产生幻觉，需引入外部工具提供实时数据和计算能力。

Method: 设计一个可调取外部API以获取相关信息的框架，并整合计算工具如计算器和日历，增强模型回答复杂查询的能力。

Result: 在多模态语言理解数据集上测试，Athena框架在数学推理达83%准确率，科学推理达88%，明显优于当前所有顶级模型。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了大语言模型的查询表现，促进构建围绕LLM的复杂计算生态系统，支持更自然和多样化的任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统回顾了2018-2024年间68篇医学视觉问答相关文献，并调查了印度和泰国的50位临床医生，评估MedVQA在临床应用中的实用性和存在的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管医学视觉问答技术取得进展，但其在临床流程中的应用仍有限，本文旨在识别当前技术的不足和临床需求的差距。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围回顾框架，结合文献综述和医生问卷调查，深入分析MedVQA的研究进展与实际临床需求。

Result: 发现近60%的问答对缺乏诊断价值，数据集和模型未支持多视角、多分辨率影像及电子病历集成，评价指标与临床需求不匹配。调查显示仅29.8%的医生认为MedVQA系统高度有用，主要担忧包括缺乏患者病史和领域知识、多视角图像支持不足等。

Conclusion: 要实现MedVQA在临床的有效整合，必须解决多模态分析能力不足、缺少患者背景信息及评价体系不匹配等挑战。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

TL;DR: 该论文提出CRISP数据集，通过训练小型模型生成高质量的多领域高层次推理计划，提升复杂问题解决能力，优于大模型少样本提示和链式思维方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在复杂问题推理方面仍显不足，现有基于Chain-of-Thought的推理和无训练的计划生成方法效果有限，因此需要更有效的高层次计划生成方法。

Method: 构建多领域CRISP数据集，自动生成并验证数学推理和代码生成的高层次计划，利用LLM作为评判标准进行内在验证，并通过下游任务性能进行外部验证；在此基础上微调小模型以提升计划生成质量。

Result: 微调后的小模型在生成计划质量上优于使用少样本提示的大型模型，显著超过链式思维表现，并且在不同领域间表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过专门数据集训练的小模型能有效提升高层次计划生成质量，从而增强复杂领域的推理能力，该方法具有较强的跨领域泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化或辅助科学研究中的消融实验设计，提高研究过程的效率和准确性。

Method: 提出包含两个任务（作者消融和评审消融）的AblationBench基准套件，开发基于语言模型的自动评估机制，并利用当前顶尖语言模型进行实验。

Result: 顶尖语言模型在识别消融实验方面表现不佳，最高准确率仅29%，而且链式思考提示方法优于基于代理的方法。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在支持消融实验设计方面仍存在显著挑战，但链式思考提示显示出更好的潜力，未来研究可在此方向深入。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Krul系统，通过动态选择KV缓存压缩策略，提升多轮对话中大型语言模型的状态恢复效率，显著减少响应时间和存储空间，同时保证生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话中，恢复大型语言模型的状态面临KV缓存重计算或加载的高开销，现有的压缩方法采用固定策略，忽略对话间注意力模式差异，导致准确率下降。

Method: Krul系统基于层间注意力相似度动态选择压缩策略，采用预压缩策略选择器、基于token的异质注意力相似度估计器和无气泡恢复调度器，结合重计算和加载流水线实现KV缓存高效恢复。

Result: 在真实任务中，Krul实现了1.5到2.68倍的首次生成时间缩短，以及1.33到2.35倍的KV缓存存储减少，且生成质量无明显下降。

Conclusion: 动态且定制化的KV缓存压缩策略显著提升了多轮对话中大型语言模型的状态恢复效率，为高效推理提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型生成SPARQL查询的新方法，无需微调，通过执行查询探索知识图谱，实现在多个数据集上的领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的方法往往需要模型微调，使用成本高，且在不同知识图谱上的适应性较差。该研究希望提出一种无需微调、通用性强的方法。

Method: 利用大型语言模型，通过策略性执行SPARQL查询来探索RDF知识图谱，搜索相关的IRI和字面值，支持零样本学习。评测涵盖多种知识图谱和语言模型，并进行多种对比实验和补充研究。

Result: 在Wikidata上实现了多项基准测试的最新成果，Freebase上的表现接近最优few-shot方法，在其他知识图谱和基准上整体表现良好，并通过补充实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖微调，能够高效生成SPARQL查询，具有较强的通用性和竞争力，适合多种知识图谱和语言模型应用场景。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Conclusion: 该框架支持将语言模型负责任地、安全透明地集成入实际决策流程，减少风险并提升应用效果，具有广泛应用潜力，如医疗和法律领域。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Compactor的无参数查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数评估token重要性，显著降低了记忆占用并维持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM支持大上下文，但KV缓存的线性内存需求成为性能和成本瓶颈，亟需有效的缓存压缩技术。

Method: 提出Compactor方法，利用近似杠杆分数无参数无查询地压缩KV缓存，并引入上下文校准压缩以推断最大压缩率。

Result: Compactor在合成和真实任务中保持性能同时减少50%缓存token，使用上下文校准压缩平均节省63%内存，适用于多个LLM和任务。

Conclusion: Compactor是一种高效通用的KV缓存压缩技术，显著减轻内存负担，支持大上下文生成任务，有助于实际部署优化。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型因资源限制常用于需要人机频繁互动的场景，如智能手机，因此必须保留LLMs中的同理心能力，以保障正向人际交流。

Method: 本文设计了两步微调流程，利用从LLMs蒸馏而来的同理心对话数据，并提出四组独特提示词，超越基础直接提示以提升同理心蒸馏效果。

Result: 通过两步微调和改进提示词训练的小模型在生成同理心回应方面，胜率显著达到90%，比基础提示方法高出10%。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了通过目标性提示和两步微调，能够有效将LLMs的同理心能力蒸馏到体积更小的SLMs中，提升其人机交互质量。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful

especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness

TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在微调过程中表现出的超出上下文推理能力（OOCR），发现这主要源于LoRA微调时添加的恒定引导向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM在微调过程中如何实现出乎意料的深层泛化能力及其机制，这对模型的安全和可靠部署至关重要。

Method: 通过机制分析和实验，揭示LoRA微调通过添加恒定引导向量，引导模型向某个通用概念，从而实现OOCR，并验证从头训练引导向量也能诱导出此能力。

Result: 发现OOCR现象在多种任务中均可通过引导向量的作用解释，甚至条件行为任务（如模型后门）也能通过无条件添加引导向量实现。

Conclusion: 本文提出OOCR能力的一个解释——微调学到的引导向量引导模型实现泛化，为理解LLMs为何能进行上下文外推理提供了新的视角，有助于其安全可靠应用。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型作为智能辅导系统中代理学生的表现，并通过项目反应理论对比其与真实学生的能力差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在模拟真实学生行为和特征方面的准确性，评估其作为代理学生的可行性。

Method: 收集了包含数学和阅读理解的学生测试数据，利用项目反应理论（IRT）将11种多样化的大型语言模型置于与真实学生相同的能力尺度上进行比较。

Result: 强大的通用模型无指导下持续优于平均学生，中弱模型偶尔与真实学生表现相符；通过等级限制提示调整模型表现，但不同模型与提示组合的表现差异显著且不稳定。

Conclusion: 当前模型和提示组合尚无法全面模拟各学科和年级的学生表现，需开发新的训练和评估策略，并提供了代理模型选择的指导建议。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

Motivation: 早期关于疼痛的研究多忽视性别因素，本研究旨在深入探讨性别对疼痛体验的影响。

Method: 采用隐藏属性模型卷积神经网络（HAM-CNN）对网络帖子进行性别分类，并分析语言差异及疾病分布。

Result: 达到0.86的F1评分，发现女性帖子情感色彩更强，女性中偏头痛和鼻窦炎更为常见，药物效果存在性别差异。

Conclusion: 性别是理解疼痛体验的重要因素，未来疼痛研究和治疗应考虑性别差异以实现个性化医疗。

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Motivation: 推理密集任务中模型容易出现过度思考，导致效率低下和资源浪费，亟需一种动态调整推理模式的方法以提升性能和效率。

Method: 构建双模式数据集，采用多Token预测知识蒸馏实现细粒度推理转移，冷启动策略引入模式选择先验，提出Step-SRPO强化学习算法引入中间监督，优化推理模式选择和回答准确性。

Result: KAT在多个基准测试中表现优异，匹配甚至超越DeepSeek-R1-0528和Qwen3-235B-A22B，推理任务中减少约30%令牌使用，且已成功部署于快手内部编码助手，提高开发效率和准确性。

Conclusion: AutoThink范式有效提升大型语言模型在推理密集任务中的性能和效率，具有良好的扩展性，未来可扩展至更大规模模型以取得更优表现。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种同步自我复习（SSR）微调方法，解决多模态大语言模型在文档图像机器翻译任务中的遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型虽在OCR任务中表现优秀，但在处理跨模态跨语言的文档图像机器翻译任务时表现欠佳，且传统的监督微调方法导致模型遗忘已有的OCR能力。

Method: 提出同步自我复习（SSR）范式，先让模型生成OCR文本，再进行翻译文本生成，以保持模型的OCR能力同时提升翻译性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，SSR能有效减轻灾难性遗忘，提升模型在OCR和文档图像机器翻译任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR方法有效提升了多模态大语言模型的双语认知优势，使其在OCR和文档图像机器翻译任务中表现更平衡和优异。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

*Yinzhu Quan,Xinrui Li,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了CRMAgent，一个基于大型语言模型的多智能系统，用于生成高质量的电商私域渠道营销消息模板和写作指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商私域渠道中大多数商家缺乏撰写高效营销文案的专业知识和可扩展工具，导致用户留存和转化效果不佳。

Method: CRMAgent通过三种模式提升文案质量：1）基于群组学习，从商家自有优质消息中学习并重写表现差的文案；2）检索与适应，根据相似受众和品类检索高效模板并适配当前活动；3）基于规则的备用方案，在无合适参考时进行零样本重写。

Result: 大量实验表明，CRMAgent生成的模板在匹配受众和营销效果指标上显著优于商家的原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent有效提升私域电商营销文案质量和效果，解决了商家缺乏专业文案能力和工具的难题。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Motivation: 亟需一种无需额外训练数据即可高效将专利内容转化为实际可行产品创意的方法，提升专利的商业价值。

Method: 采用Gemini 2.5模型多轮编辑和拼接提示词，利用GPT-4.1生成创意，Qwen3-8B通过Elo循环机制评价筛选最佳提示词组合。

Result: MK2在三个领域、两种评估类型和六项指标上均表现优异，自动排行榜排名第一，36项测试中赢得25项，唯材料化学领域表现欠佳。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示词工程已能为专利创意生成提供具有商业竞争力的解决方案，但特定领域仍需更深入的专业知识支持。

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了信息检索中训练文本再排序器的两种主流策略：对比学习和知识蒸馏，发现知识蒸馏在有大模型教师时表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习和知识蒸馏均被用于训练文本再排序器，但缺乏在实际条件下针对跨编码器再排序器两者效果的直接比较。

Method: 在相同数据下，使用对比学习和以强大的对比学习模型作为教师的知识蒸馏方法，训练不同大小和架构的再排序器进行性能评估。

Result: 知识蒸馏在存在更大教师模型时，学生模型在域内外排名性能上优于对比学习，且此结果适用于不同大小和架构的学生模型；而同容量教师模型的蒸馏优势不明显。

Conclusion: 建议如果有更大教师模型，优先采用知识蒸馏训练小型再排序器；否则对比学习是更稳健有效的选择。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了不同方法对大型语言模型(LLMs)和推理大型语言模型(RLLMs)在金融问答任务中性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺少系统性研究探讨如何充分发挥LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域的性能。

Method: 利用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs，测试提示方法、agent框架和多语言对齐方法对金融问答任务的影响。

Result: 提示方法和agent框架提升了LLMs表现；RLLMs的内生Long CoT能力限制了传统方法的提升效果；多语言对齐方法主要提升了LLMs的多语言能力，对RLLMs效果有限。

Conclusion: 本研究为金融领域中的LLMs和RLLMs性能提升提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

TL;DR: 本文评估了n-gram和神经网络两种自动评价指标在不同语言和任务中的适用性，发现这些指标对语言类型敏感，尤其n-gram指标在屈折语中表现较差，但通过合适的分词处理能改善。神经网络评价指标在低资源语言上效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前自动评价指标如ROUGE在英语生成任务中较为有效，但它们在其他语言中的适用性尚不明确，特别是面对不同语言类型和资源条件。

Method: 设计了一个涵盖八种语言、四种语法类型（黏着语、孤立语、低屈折语、高屈折语）和不同资源水平的大规模评价任务，系统对比n-gram基础评价与神经网络基础评价指标与人工判断的相关性。

Result: 发现评价指标对语言类型敏感，n-gram指标在屈折语中相关性较低，但通过合理的分词处理可显著提升；同时，专门训练用于评价的神经网络指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更佳且与人工判断相关性更高。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在屈折语中存在明显局限，推荐更多投入神经网络评价指标的训练，以提升不同语言和资源条件下生成任务评价的准确性与一致性。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Motivation: 减少语言模型生成错误事实信息（幻觉），但获取高质量事实数据成本高且可能导致更多幻觉。

Method: 比较在黄金事实数据与模型生成且模型认为真实的数据上的微调效果，评估各种数据过滤策略对事实性的影响。

Result: 基于模型自己内部判断过滤的模型生成数据微调，整体事实性优于其他配置，在多个领域均有效。

Conclusion: 模型自身的真实性判断是提升语言模型事实性的有效信号，训练时优先选择模型认为真实的数据更能减少幻觉。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential
across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research
methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a
systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains
underexplored. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
application of LLMs in interdisciplinary studies, categorising research efforts
from both a technical perspective and with regard to their applicability. From
a technical standpoint, key methodologies such as supervised fine-tuning,
retrieval-augmented generation, agent-based approaches, and tool-use
integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and
applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的针对大型语言模型的知识编辑方法在传播关联事实的连锁效应时难以保持逻辑一致性。

Method: ChainEdit自动从结构化知识库中提取逻辑模式，并将其与LLM内部逻辑对齐，动态生成和编辑逻辑关联的知识簇。

Result: 实验显示，ChainEdit在逻辑泛化能力上比基线方法提升了30%以上，同时保持了编辑的可靠性和特异性；此外，通过知识感知的评估协议，解决了现有基准测试的评价偏差。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在保证知识编辑后内部逻辑一致性的同时，实现了在连锁反应效果上的最新最佳性能。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and

*Selina Heller,Mohamed Ibrahim,David Antony Selby,Sebastian Vollmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出并评估了基于大型语言模型(LLM)多智能体系统模拟决策会议，重点在于检测参与者间的意见一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策会议是跨领域专家一起讨论复杂问题并达成共识的关键形式，但现实中会议效率和一致性检测存在难题。LLM多智能体系统能够模拟实际群体互动，具有提升会议效率与决策质量的潜力。

Method: 设计了一个基于六种不同LLM的多智能体系统，通过立场检测和立场极性检测两项任务评估模型对参与者意见的一致性识别能力，并将该检测模块集成在模拟决策会议的多智能体系统中。

Result: 实验表明，LLM能够可靠检测动态且复杂的辩论中的意见一致性，且引入一致性检测智能体后，群体辩论效率和讨论质量进一步提升，模拟结果与现实决策会议的效果相当。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统具备有效模拟群体决策过程的能力，能够支持跨领域专家会议中的决策制定，为未来利用AI辅助专家决策提供了新途径。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各种任务中的广泛应用，需要自动化框架系统地分类和归因模型错误，以便高效分析模型性能和诊断回答缺陷。

Method: 建立包含6个主类和15个子类的误归因框架，构建专门的错误归因数据集AttriData，并基于该数据集微调生成评分、误归因和反馈的判别模型MisAttributionLLM。

Conclusion: 本研究首次提出一整套系统化错误归因框架及相应模型，实现了对大语言模型回答错误的自动化评分、归因和反馈，促进模型性能分析和改进。

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在奥地利及欧盟增值税法律框架下辅助法律决策的能力，发现适当配置的LLM能够支持税务顾问自动化例行任务并提供法律依据的初步分析，但尚不适合完全自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务咨询中客户以自然语言描述案例，LLM有潜力减轻税务专业人员的工作负担，但LLM易产生幻觉，法律领域要求高准确性和合理性。

Method: 通过微调和检索增强生成（RAG）两种方法，结合教科书案例和真实税务咨询案例，系统评估LLM的法律推理能力并优化系统配置。

Result: 适当配置的LLM能有效支持增值税相关任务，并提供法律依据的决策分析。现有模型能自动完成例行任务，但因法律领域敏感性，尚无法完全自动化。

Conclusion: LLM在税务决策支持中具备潜力，但需增强对隐含客户知识和特定上下文文件的处理能力，未来需整合结构化背景信息以提升表现。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Abstract: The deep integration of large language models and automatic speech
recognition systems has become a promising research direction with high
practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work
proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Conclusion: clembench填补了对话游戏评测工具的空白，促进了目标导向、多轮交互的LLM评测方法的推广和应用。

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型虽然在程序规划中具备强大推理能力，但在多模态信息融合和反事实推理方面仍有缺陷，限制了其在具身AI系统中的应用效果。

Method: 设计了基于视觉语言模型的LLaPa框架，结合任务环境重排序模块（TER）通过任务敏感分割对视觉与文本信息进行对齐，以及反事实活动检索器（CAR）以增强模型对潜在反事实条件的识别和推理能力。

Result: 在ActPlan-1K和ALFRED基准测试中，LLaPa生成的动作序列计划在计划质量（LCS得分）和正确率上均优于现有先进模型。

Conclusion: 通过引入多模态输入和反事实推理的辅助模块，LLaPa显著提升了多模态程序规划的性能，为具身AI系统的任务规划提供了新的有效方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are
available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.

TL;DR: 本文研究了将大型语言模型（LLM）引入潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）主题模型的初始化和后校正两个阶段，以提升主题模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDA模型高度依赖初始化质量，作者希望通过利用LLM来改善初始化过程，并通过后校正进一步提升模型性能。

Method: 在初始化阶段，采用LLM引导主题聚类以初始化Gibbs采样算法；在后校正阶段，利用LLM对结果进行修正。

Result: 实验表明，LLM引导的初始化虽改善了早期迭代，但对收敛无贡献且性能最差；LLM后校正提升了主题连贯性5.86%。

Conclusion: 将LLM融入LDA后校正阶段能显著提升效果，但仅在初始化阶段并非有效，挑战了LLM始终优于传统文本挖掘方法的观点。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Result: 发现说话人归属对词级转录错误表现出较强的鲁棒性，且恢复真实转录文本的目标与归属性能关联度低。

Conclusion: ASR生成的具错误的转录文本在说话人归属任务中表现不亚于甚至优于人工转录文本，可能因错误包含了揭示说话人身份的特征。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在将非正式数学形式化方面受限于多语言平行语料库的数量和质量。

Method: 设计了新的知识方程（KEs）语言，先将自然语言翻译成KEs，再通过严格定义的规则转换为Lean、Coq、Isabelle等形式化语言，形成超过6万条平行语料。

Result: 在MiniF2F基准测试中取得88.9%的语法准确率（pass@1），优于Deepseek-V3和Herald等最新模型。

Conclusion: 提出的KELPS框架有效提升了非正式数学到形式化证明的转换质量，为多语言形式化定理证明提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在推理阶段动态融合知识图谱的新框架，避免了参数微调带来的问题，实现实时知识更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图增强方法依赖参数微调，存在灾难性遗忘和泛化能力下降的问题，且难以适应实时知识更新。

Method: 设计了知识图指导注意力（KGA）模块，包含外向聚合（动态融合外部知识）和内向聚合（过滤无关信息并反馈相关三元组）两个互补通路，实现闭环增强且不更新参数。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，KGA的知识融合性能与微调方法相当，支持实时知识融合。

Conclusion: KGA模块通过闭环注意力机制，无需参数更新即可实现对大型语言模型的动态知识图融合，有效解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

TL;DR: 提出了MM-Coder，一种融合UML图和流程图的多模态多语言代码生成模型，提高代码生成的准确性和架构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成模型大多仅处理文本，忽略了实际软件开发中关键的视觉辅助信息，如图表和流程图。

Method: 设计了MM-Coder，结合视觉设计输入（UML图、流程图）和文本指令，并构建了多模态指令调优数据集MMc-Instruct，训练模型能综合文本与图形信息；同时开发了多模态代码生成评测基准MMEval。

Result: 评测显示MM-Coder在精准捕获视觉信息、遵循指令及高级编程知识方面仍存挑战，但显著推动了多模态代码生成的研究。

Conclusion: 通过融合文本与视觉设计，MM-Coder有望革新工业编程，实现复杂规格的精准实现及理解。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的隐式控制语言模型的方法——缓存引导，通过一次性干预键值缓存，实现无需微调的推理行为引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导技术需要连续干预，存在超参数不稳定和推理效率低的问题，迫切需要一种高效且易于集成的推理控制方法。

Method: 利用GPT-4o生成的推理轨迹，构造引导向量，对语言模型的键值缓存进行一次性干预，从而引导模型生成更明确的多步链式推理，无需修改提示或微调模型。

Result: 实验证明，缓存引导显著提升了模型推理的结构性和任务性能，相较于连续干预的激活引导，缓存引导在超参数稳定性、推理效率和集成简便性方面具有明显优势。

Conclusion: 缓存引导作为一种更稳健实用的生成控制方案，可有效实现小型语言模型的链式推理引导，提升模型表现与控制能力。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

### [126] [An Enhanced Privacy-preserving Federated Few-shot Learning Framework for Respiratory Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08050)
*Ming Wang,Zhaoyang Duan,Dong Xue,Fangzhou Liu,Zhongheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合联邦学习和少样本学习的隐私保护呼吸疾病诊断框架，通过引入元随机梯度下降算法和差分隐私技术，解决了数据稀缺和隐私泄露问题，实验验证了该方法在不同数据结构和分布上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据标注劳动强度大，导致高质量标注数据稀缺，且患者隐私保护限制了数据共享，传统集中式方法难以兼顾大数据需求与隐私保护。

Method: 提出了联邦少样本学习框架，利用元随机梯度下降算法减缓过拟合风险，并在梯度中加入高斯分布差分隐私噪声防止梯度泄露，采用加权平均算法聚合不同机构本地模型。

Result: 实验表明，在差分隐私机制下，该方法能够有效利用来自不同机构和数据分布的呼吸疾病数据，实现精准诊断。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多机构呼吸疾病诊断中数据标注稀缺和隐私保护的矛盾，提升了模型的泛化能力和数据安全性，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对树状Parzen估计器（TPE）的高效组合优化算法，通过引入距离结构的类别核并优化其计算复杂度，提高了在大规模组合搜索空间中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TPE方法在深度学习领域的多目标和多保真优化中表现良好，但其在组合优化领域尚未充分应用，而组合优化在化学和生物学中非常重要。

Method: 本文将类别核与数值核相结合，引入距离结构以改进类别核，并针对大规模组合搜索空间优化核计算的时间复杂度。

Result: 在合成问题的实验中，新方法以更少的评估次数找到了比原始TPE更优的解。

Conclusion: 所提出的组合优化算法显著提升了TPE在大规模组合搜索空间中的表现，已集成于开源HPO框架Optuna中。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

### [128] [Quantile Reward Policy Optimization: Alignment with Pointwise Regression and Exact Partition Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08068)
*Simon Matrenok,Skander Moalla,Caglar Gulcehre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的大语言模型训练方法QRPO，结合了点绝对奖励和离线训练的优点，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法么要么依赖在线、策略内算法来使用点绝对奖励，要么只能用相对偏好信号，限制了训练的应用和效果。

Method: 引入定量奖励统计，实现对KL正则化RL目标的闭式解回归，使得训练过程更简洁且支持离线学习，同时通过增加计算量提升奖励估计精度。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编程任务（奖励模型评分、AlpacaEval 2、LeetCode）上均优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO，且缓解了训练中的长度偏差。

Conclusion: QRPO为利用点绝对奖励进行大规模离线训练提供了有效方法，兼具性能提升和应用灵活性，具有广泛的实际意义。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出MoFaSGD，一种基于低秩奇异值分解的动态更新动量方法，用于高效微调大规模基础模型，显著降低内存消耗同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模基础模型微调时，存储状态优化器（如AdamW）造成显存需求大增，现有低内存方法存在子空间固定或计算成本高的问题。

Method: MoFaSGD通过动态更新低秩SVD表示一阶动量，逼近全秩动量，实现动态优化子空间更新，并利用低秩动量因子进行频谱归一化更新。

Result: MoFaSGD在大语言模型对齐任务上表现出与LoRA相当的内存节省和与最先进低秩优化方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD在理论上保证收敛性，实验证明其在内存效率和性能之间达到优良平衡，是微调大型模型的有效方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

*Hardik Shukla,Manurag Khullar,Vismay Churiwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于PDE残差梯度方差自适应参数更新的PDE-aware优化器，用于提升物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在求解偏微分方程中的训练稳定性和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器如Adam在平衡损失函数中多项物理约束时表现不佳，尤其是在刚性或病态系统中，导致收敛不稳定和误差较大。

Method: 设计了一种PDE-aware优化器，通过利用每个样本的PDE残差梯度的方差动态调整参数更新，避免梯度方向不一致的问题，同时减少了第二阶优化器如SOAP带来的巨大计算负担。

Result: 在1D Burgers'方程、Allen-Cahn方程和Korteweg-de Vries方程上进行实验，结果显示该优化器相比Adam和SOAP实现了更平滑的收敛路径和更低的绝对误差，尤其是在梯度急剧变化区域表现突出。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知的自适应优化策略显著提升了PINNs的训练稳定性和精度，未来研究将着重于在更大规模模型和硬件加速器上的扩展应用。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Result: 理论证明QRPINNs收敛速度优于PINNs，实验表明其在高维问题上显著优于PINNs及部分自适应采样方法。

Conclusion: QRPINNs通过改进采样策略有效提升了物理信息神经网络的求解性能，尤其适用于高维偏微分方程问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络无法严格满足物理约束，导致工程系统中模型预测的可靠性和一致性较差。

Method: 通过解决距离最小化问题的Karush-Kuhn-Tucker条件，采用投影方法严格满足约束。并利用对数指数变换构造稀疏线性指数系统，使投影可微。

Result: 在测试问题和真实化学过程模拟中，KKT-Hardnet比多层感知机和传统PINNs展现出更高的精度和严格的约束满足。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了领域知识与机器学习的融合，促进了复杂系统可信混合建模的发展。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM有效提升了城市交通风险预测的准确性和置信度，适用于长上下文多模态数据，为实际交通安全提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a

encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3

Conclusion: Text-LENS有效利用题目文本特征，增强了模型对新题目的学习与预测能力，提升了教育评估的灵活性和泛化性。

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

TL;DR: 本文探索通过生理信号推断情绪状态，提出了一种保护隐私的替代面部识别的方法，采用量子支持向量机（SVM）实现高效分类，优于传统算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部识别技术存在隐私问题，且情绪检测在某些特殊人群（如阿尔茨海默病患者和 PTSD 退伍军人）中具有重要应用需求，因此研究一种隐私保护且准确的情绪识别方法。

Method: 比较了经典机器学习算法与基于量子核的混合量子机器学习模型，使用可穿戴传感器数据进行情绪状态分类，重点评估量子增强的支持向量机性能。

Result: 量子增强的支持向量机在所有情绪类别中均优于传统模型，F1值超过80%，召回率提升最高达36%，表现出更高准确度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合可穿戴设备与量子机器学习可实现无侵入式、高效的情绪识别，为有交流障碍人群的临床或照护环境提供了新型的被动情绪监测方案。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living
conditions.

Motivation: 现有逆强化学习方法大多假设示范是专家级的，且难以处理次优、长时 horizon 或对抗性任务，限制了其在复杂机器人任务中的应用。

Method: 提出了SPLASH方法，通过结合样本高效的偏好逆强化学习，处理次优的层级示范，针对长时 horizon 和对抗性任务进行优化。

Result: 通过海事夺旗模拟任务及无人水面艇实地sim-to-real实验，验证SPLASH显著优于现有从次优示范中学习奖励的方法。

Conclusion: SPLASH有效地解决了逆强化学习中处理次优示范且适用于长时 horizon 和对抗性任务的挑战，推动了其实际机器人应用的前景。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于马尔可夫决策过程的新型连锁思维推理框架CTRLS，通过分布式强化学习更系统地探索推理路径，提升了推理准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连锁思维(CoT)方法依赖启发式采样，缺乏对推理状态转移的结构化建模，限制了探索多样有效推理路径的能力。

Method: 将CoT推理视为带潜在状态转移的马尔可夫决策过程，利用分布式强化学习显式建模推理动作的不确定性，通过ε-贪婪探索和基于熵的正则化策略迭代优化潜在状态转移，无需对大语言模型进行额外微调。

Result: 理论上提供了证据下界（ELBO），实验证明该方法在多个推理基准任务中提升了推理准确率、多样性和探索效率。

Conclusion: CTRLS框架通过结构化和不确定性建模，有效提升了大语言模型的推理性能和多样性，为连锁思维推理方法提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于进化算法的图神经网络攻击方法EvA，直接解决离散优化问题，不依赖梯度信息，适应黑盒模型，提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法依赖梯度信息，将离散优化问题放宽为连续空间，导致次优解及对非可微目标的适应性差。

Result: EvA攻击在多个实验中平均使准确率额外下降约11%，优于现有最优攻击方法。

Conclusion: EvA展现出设计图神经网络攻击的新潜力，能有效突破鲁棒性证书和共形集，推动攻击策略的发展。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Conclusion: CoreSPECT有效结合分布和几何信息，提升传统算法表现，并具备理论保障和噪声鲁棒性。

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

training configurations at

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Conclusion: QML在特定领域具备重要潜力，但必须通过开发量子本地算法、改进误差校正技术及建立实际基准测试，才能实现理论优势向实际应用的转化。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Motivation: 传统两样本检验方法直接应用于聚类生成的子集时，会产生过小的p值，造成类型I错误率膨胀，因此需要一种专门针对两簇检验的新方法。

Result: 实验表明该方法能显著降低类型I错误率，优于多种经典两样本检验方法。

Conclusion: 该两簇检验方法有效且实用，已成功应用于基于树的可解释聚类和基于显著性的层次聚类中。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Conclusion: 通过引入在线预训练阶段，OPT有效缓解了离线预训练智能体在在线微调中价值估计误差，提升整体强化学习性能。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Motivation: 现有的bagging方法采用简单随机抽样(SRS)，导致训练数据存在较大随机性，从而增加经验损失的方差，影响MLP的泛化性能。

Method: 通过引入排序集合抽样(RSS)替代简单随机抽样用于生成训练数据集，构建RSS-MLP方法，理论证明RSS可减少经验指数损失和逻辑损失的方差。

Result: 在12个基准数据集上，基于两种凸损失函数和两种融合方法的实验显示RSS-MLP在降低损失方差和提升性能方面优于传统bagging方法。

Conclusion: RSS-MLP方法有效降低了经验损失的方差，增强了MLP的泛化能力，验证了引入排序结构进行样本采样的合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

Motivation: 优化器在大型语言模型预训练中起决定性作用，不同优化器对训练时间和模型性能有不同影响，需对比分析以选择最优方案。

Method: 在两种基础模型架构上，通过单轮和多轮训练（保持相同Token量），使用最大更新参数化和较小代理模型分别调优超参数，比较AdamW、Lion和Sophia三种优化器性能。

Result: Sophia在训练和验证损失上表现最好，Lion在训练GPU时间上最快，而AdamW在下游任务评估中表现最优，三者性能大致相当。

Conclusion: 不同优化器各有优势，选择优化器需根据具体需求权衡训练速度、训练损失和下游任务表现。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

Conclusion: 结构化的离散空间扩散机制对化学反应预测具有明显优势，SynBridge有效捕捉了化学反应的离散转变特征，提升了多任务反应预测的精度。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

Motivation: 顺序联邦学习（SFL）因其在数据异构性下的强收敛性受到关注，但存在严重的灾难性遗忘问题，模型容易遗忘之前客户端学到的知识。

Method: 提出SFedKD框架，采用多教师知识蒸馏，基于教师与学生数据类分布差异，为目标类和非目标类知识赋予不同权重；引入冗余教师消除机制，将教师选择问题转化为最大覆盖问题，设计互补基础的贪心教师选择算法，提升训练效果同时降低通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: SFedKD通过差异感知的多教师知识蒸馏策略，显著缓解了顺序联邦学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效优化多样化目标，展示了其多功能性与实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为RL中行为对齐提供了新的灵活途径，无需修改奖励函数即可适配复杂目标，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于transformer和混合专家模型的深度学习框架CircFormerMoE，能够直接从植物基因组DNA预测环状RNA（circRNA），解决了传统方法依赖RNA测序数据且计算量大、效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统circRNA鉴定方法依赖高通量RNA测序和复杂的比对算法，计算成本高且难以直接从基因组DNA序列预测，尤其在植物中由于剪接位点缺乏典型GT-AG基序，现有模型泛化能力有限且已知circRNA数量远低于实际丰度。

Method: 提出基于transformer和混合专家模型的CircFormerMoE框架，包括剪接位点检测（SSD）和剪接位点配对（SSP）两个子任务，直接从基因组DNA序列进行circRNA预测。

Result: 该模型在10个植物物种基因数据上验证了有效性，能够发现先前未注释的circRNA，并通过模型可解释性分析揭示序列模式。

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE为植物大规模circRNA发现提供了一种快速、准确的计算方法，有助于植物功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释的未来研究。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合风险势场的时空风险注意轨迹预测框架，能够更准确地预测高风险交通场景下的车辆轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车辆轨迹预测方法多聚焦于观察到的运动模式和车辆交互，忽略了周围车辆不确定或激进行为带来的潜在风险。

Method: 引入风险势场评估周围车辆行为风险，通过时空编码器和风险注意特征融合解码器将风险势场融合至时空特征中，设计风险加权损失函数提升高风险场景预测准确度。

Result: 在NGSIM和HighD数据集上的实验显示，该方法平均预测误差分别降低了4.8%和31.2%，在高风险场景下表现尤为显著。

Conclusion: 该框架能提供可解释的风险感知预测，提高自动驾驶系统在复杂交通环境中的决策鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AbbIE的递归编码器结构，通过迭代在潜在空间中进行计算，实现了较标准Transformer更优的困惑度和动态计算资源扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提升Transformer模型性能和灵活利用计算资源，解决传统固定规模模型的限制。

Method: 引入了基于块的自回归递归编码器AbbIE，在潜在空间迭代计算，训练时仅用2次迭代，测试时支持任意迭代次数泛化。

Result: AbbIE比标准Transformer在语言困惑度提升5%，在零样本上下文学习任务中提升12%，优于其他迭代及标准方法。

Conclusion: AbbIE展示了通过递归结构和动态计算扩展可有效提升Transformer性能，为模型性能扩展提供新思路。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Motivation: 恶意软件分类模型因概念漂移导致性能下降，且频繁更新依赖昂贵的人工标注，现有方法中结合无标签数据的半监督学习应用不足。

Method: 提出ADAPT算法，一种模型无关的伪标签半监督方法，适用于神经网络和树模型，通过利用未标注数据改善模型对变化数据分布的适应能力。

Result: 在Android、Windows、PDF等五个多样化数据集上的大规模实验表明，ADAPT方法在性能上持续优于基线模型和其他竞争性方法。

Conclusion: ADAPT算法有效解决了恶意软件检测中的概念漂移问题，促进了机器学习模型对动态数据环境的适应，提高了检测效果。

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Sentinel-1卫星遥感数据的水稻可持续灌溉管理监测框架，能够有效识别直接播种水稻和传统水田耕作方式，支持大规模监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻种植消耗大量全球淡水资源，尤其在印度旁遮普地区地下水资源严重枯竭，采用可持续灌溉方法（如直接播种水稻和轮灌法）可以显著节水，但缺乏有效的采纳监测数据，影响政策制定和资源配置。

Method: 结合自然保护组织的农户实地调查数据，利用Sentinel-1卫星图像开发分类系统，通过植株播种和灌溉特征区分不同水稻种植方式，无需预先知道播种日期。

Result: 该方法在区分直接播种水稻与传统插秧水稻中达到78%的F1分数，成功在约300万个农田地块推断直接播种水稻的采纳率，预测结果与政府记录相关系数为0.77。

Conclusion: 该研究框架可为政策制定者提供可靠的监测工具，实现大规模追踪可持续灌溉实践的推广效果，助力科学决策与目标资源分配，推动水资源可持续管理和粮食安全目标的实现。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于多智能体强化学习的无监督图像字幕生成方法LoGIC，通过训练“说话者”和“听者”两个代理实现自然语言交流策略，提升图像字幕生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标注数据集已被大规模视觉语言模型训练使用，难以进一步提升性能，无监督图像字幕生成研究不足，亟需有效方法。

Method: 提出Lewis Communication Game for Image Captioning（LoGIC），通过多智能体强化学习，使用预训练视觉语言模型作为“说话者”、大语言模型作为“听者”，在协作共奖赏设置下训练代理，实现图像与语言的自然交流。

Result: 使用预训练模型微调后，LoGIC在无额外标注情况下BLEU指标达46分，比基础视觉语言模型提高2分；从零训练轻量模型在无监督设置下BLEU达31分，较现有无监督方法提升10分。

Conclusion: LoGIC创新利用多智能体强化学习，有效提升了无监督图像字幕生成性能，展示了结合预训练模型和通信策略在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

TL;DR: FedAKD是一种针对联邦学习中不平衡协变量转移问题的异步知识蒸馏方法，旨在提高协作公平性和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习方法忽视了不平衡协变量转移这一复杂异质性问题，影响模型的协作公平性。

Method: 提出FedAKD，通过异步知识蒸馏策略，利用正确预测样本的特征分布相似性和错误样本的分布差异，先固定全局模型更新客户端模型，再利用高置信度正确样本更新全局模型，最后服务器聚合客户端模型。

Result: 在FashionMNIST、CIFAR10及真实电子健康记录数据集上，FedAKD显著提升了协作公平性、预测准确性及客户端参与度。

Conclusion: FedAKD有效解决了联邦学习中的不平衡协变量转移问题，实现了理论收敛并提升了实际应用中的公平性和性能。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: WERSA是一种新型的线性时间复杂度注意力机制，利用随机谱特征和多分辨率小波融合，实现高效处理长序列且提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在处理长序列时因注意力机制的二次复杂度导致计算成本高昂，限制了长序列处理的实用性。

Method: 提出WERSA机制，结合内容自适应的随机谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波以及可学习参数，实现选择性关注信息尺度，同时保持线性时间复杂度。

Result: WERSA在各种任务和基准测试（视觉、NLP、分层推理）中均优于其他注意力机制，提升准确率且显著减少训练时间和计算资源消耗，特别是在极长序列上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: WERSA显著降低了计算负担同时保持或提升精度，使得长上下文模型在低资源硬件上更实用、更经济，有助于可持续和可扩展的AI发展。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对深度神经网络中局部过拟合现象的分析及解决方法，通过衡量遗忘率识别局部过拟合，利用训练历史构建集成再蒸馏为单模型，显著提升性能且降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理论上模型容量越大应更易过拟合，但深度网络中过拟合现象较少见且不明显，作者怀疑过拟合可能局限于数据空间的子区域，即局部过拟合。

Method: 提出遗忘率指标测量局部过拟合，发现其与双重下降现象相关；基于此，设计两阶段方法：首先通过训练历史聚合检查点形成集成模型，然后将集成知识蒸馏回单模型以提升性能同时不增加推理复杂度。

Result: 多种数据集、现代架构和训练策略的实验验证了方法有效性，在标签噪声存在条件下，该方法优于原模型和独立集成模型，带来训练和推理复杂度双重降低的优势。

Conclusion: 局部过拟合是深度学习中过拟合的一种隐形表现，通过历史集成及知识蒸馏的两阶段策略可有效恢复丢失知识，提高模型性能且减少计算负担。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

Method: 在小型强化学习环境中，基于50万次训练种子，系统地分析了距离项信赖域正则化与MDP正则化对策略镜像下降性能的影响。

Conclusion: 策略镜像下降中正则化成分的合理组合是提升强化学习算法鲁棒性和减少超参数敏感度的关键，有助于推动更健壮RL算法的研究。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将测试时适应（TTA）与风险监控框架结合的方法，用以检测模型在无标签数据下性能下降的时刻，提升模型部署的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型在测试时遇到数据分布变化会导致性能下降，虽然测试时适应（TTA）能缓解该问题，但最终模型仍可能退化并需重新训练。需要一种方法来及时检测模型性能达到不可接受的劣化点。

Method: 将现有基于置信区间的顺序检测监控工具扩展到TTA场景，使其能在模型更新且无测试标签的情况下估计性能指标，实现严格的统计风险监控。

Result: 在多个代表性数据集、分布变化类型和TTA方法上验证了所提监控框架的有效性，证明其能准确监测并报警模型性能异常。

Conclusion: 将风险监控与测试时适应结合，能有效检测模型劣化临界点，为模型部署提供有力保障，是延长模型生命周期的可行方案。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是深度神经网络在学习新任务时性能下降的问题，现有方法通过限制重要参数保护旧知识，但缺乏对参数活动阶段的深入分析。

Method: 在训练的最终平台阶段监测参数的移动和变化，识别出在损失函数平坦区域内的参数，从而使模型在保持旧知识的同时适应新任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法较全程监测参数更有效，能够更好地权衡遗忘缓解和新任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过聚焦训练末期参数活动，能更有效地减缓灾难性遗忘，同时提升模型在新任务上的表现。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Motivation: 将量子神经算子方法扩展至更高维度，提升计算能力并改善模型稳定性，解决传统方法在复杂科学计算中的局限。

Method: 在经典与量子设备之间分区执行傅里叶算子计算，利用消息传递机制分配数据，采用单元编码将输入数据编码为量子态，参数通过变分方案优化。

Result: PHQFNO在Burgers方程及不可压和可压Navier-Stokes方程上的表现达到或优于经典傅里叶神经算子，并且在不可压Navier-Stokes问题上表现更优。

Conclusion: PHQFNO成功实现了经典与量子计算的高效融合，提升了科学机器学习模型的准确性和抗噪声稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种离散时间条件高斯Koopman网络(CGKN)，用于高维复杂动力系统的状态预测和数据同化，特别针对非线性部分观测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性部分观测高维系统的高效状态预测和数据同化问题，弥补现有方法难以同时兼顾非线性动力学和观测数据的不足。

Method: 利用Koopman嵌入发现潜在状态的条件线性表示，将系统建模为条件高斯系统，利用解析解析表达式高效计算潜在状态的后验分布，并将数据同化纳入模型学习框架，统一科学机器学习与数据同化。

Result: 在多种典型非线性PDE系统（粘性Burgers方程、Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程、二维Navier-Stokes方程）上验证，CGKN在状态预测性能上与最先进的科学机器学习方法相当，且提供高效准确的数据同化结果。

Conclusion: 离散时间CGKN框架不仅提升了非线性高维系统状态预测与数据同化的性能，还示范了科学机器学习模型与其外部应用（设计优化、逆问题、最优控制）的整合潜力。

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号加速器在基因组学、NLP和网络安全等领域应用广泛，但因内存和路由复杂度过高，难以扩展到大规模数据集。

Method: 提出基于随机森林的图简化框架AutoSlim，通过分类低影响转换边并依据加权边权重自动剪枝，减少自动机图密度且保持语义正确性。

Result: 在NAPOLY+ FPGA平台上，AutoSlim在1K到64K节点数据集上测试，达到多达40%的LUT减少和30%以上的转换剪枝，支持比现有基准更大规模图。

Conclusion: AutoSlim有效降低硬件互连成本和资源暴涨，实现了大规模符号加速器图的自动化简化和优化。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Motivation: 离线强化学习中Q值线性外推导致误差，影响性能。

Method: 通过奖励缩放结合层标准化（RS-LN）和不可行动作惩罚（PA）引导Q值在数据范围外逐渐减小，构建PARS算法。

Result: PARS在多个任务和D4RL基准上的表现优于现有最先进算法，特别是在AntMaze Ultra任务中取得显著成功。

Conclusion: PARS有效缓解了Q值外推误差，提升了离线强化学习的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为BlockFFN的新型混合专家模型架构，通过改进路由机制与设计CLS感知的训练目标，显著提升了模型的稀疏性及加速效果，在低资源设备上实现3.67倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型因不可微且不灵活的路由机制限制了性能，同时低块级稀疏性导致加速效果不佳，尤其在资源受限设备上的应用受阻。

Method: 引入结合ReLU和RMSNorm的可微分路由器，设计促进Token级别和块级别稀疏性的训练目标，开发结合激活稀疏性与推测解码的高效加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在达成超80% Token级和70% 8-token块级稀疏性的同时，显著优于其他MoE基线模型，且在真实终端设备上实现高达3.67倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: BlockFFN有效提升了MoE架构的性能和加速能力，特别适合低资源设备应用，且相关代码已开源。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

Motivation: 分布式优化中通信开销严重限制了大规模信号处理和机器学习的发展，现有低秩梯度压缩方法存在高方差或无收敛保证的问题。

Method: 引入错误反馈纠正贪婪压缩的偏差，采用半懒惰子空间更新保证压缩算子收缩性，提出具有收敛保证的GreedyLore算法。

Result: 证明了GreedyLore在线性加速收敛率$mathcal{O}(sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$下有效，且在MSGD和Adam等优化器上表现优异。

Conclusion: GreedyLore成功克服了贪婪低秩梯度压缩中的偏差与非收敛问题，为降低分布式学习通信开销提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险回避强化学习方法过于保守，导致收敛于次优策略，难以有效最大化奖励或达成目标。

Method: 提出一种基于乐观探索的风险回避演员评论家方法（ORAC），通过最大化奖励值函数的局部上置信界并最小化风险成本值函数的局部下置信界动态调整代价权重，实现安全约束下的有效探索。

Result: 在Safety-Gymnasium和CityLearn等连续控制任务中，ORAC避免了收敛至次优策略，显著提升了奖励与成本的权衡表现。

Conclusion: ORAC方法有效平衡了风险回避与环境探索，促进了更优策略的学习，提升了复杂任务中的强化学习性能。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

TL;DR: 本文批判性地分析了因果抽象的概念，指出放宽线性映射限制后，因果抽象变得毫无意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前因果抽象研究普遍采用线性映射假设，但这种线性假设不是因果抽象定义所必需的。作者旨在探讨放宽线性限制后因果抽象的有效性。

Method: 作者证明了在合理假设下，任何神经网络都可以映射为任何算法，揭示了无限制映射的因果抽象变得无信息量。通过实验证明，甚至随机初始化模型也能实现完美映射。

Result: 理论证明和实验结果均表明放弃线性映射后，因果抽象失去区分能力，导致所谓的机械可解释性成为空谈。

Conclusion: 因果抽象必须结合有关信息编码的假设，才能对模型机制进行有意义的解读，未来研究应关注信息编码与因果抽象的关联。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

Conclusion: 适量的随机运动能有效防止拥堵，提高流动效率，简单的局部导航方案在实际应用中具有较高的实用价值。

Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to
reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these
spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure
for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic
experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow
as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams
do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal
attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal
agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate.
We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical
results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a
sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive
scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally
efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.

mobile robot's angular velocity, which serves as the robot's steering command.
A newly obtained visual dataset for navigation was collected in diverse
environments with varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles. During
data collection, a communication link was established over Wi-Fi between a
remote server and the robot, using Robot Operating System (ROS) topics.
Velocity commands were transmitted from the server to the robot, enabling
synchronized recording of visual data and the corresponding steering commands.
Various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error, Variance Score, and
Feed-Forward time, provided a clear comparison between the two networks and
clarified which one to use for the application.

Conclusion: SelfReVision为轻量级视觉语言模型提供了一种可扩展的自我提升路径，能够生成更具执行力的机器人规划，推动机器人任务的精准控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural
planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded
details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely
on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation
settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable
self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning.
SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify
their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing
inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms.
Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality,
execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued
fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that
SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also
outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream
embodied tasks.

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show significant potential in daily tasks. However,
reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness
degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility
of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training
paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real
worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that
precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted
perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against
perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body
control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly
enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling
successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body
trajectory tracking.

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a
GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving
reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration
enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from
vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing
methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or
precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in
practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability
issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless
extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the
GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external
targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the
known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable
calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is
developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by
integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and
motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR
configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor
setups.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法在结构化环境下表现良好，但面对复杂边界条件鲁棒性不足，且缺乏标准化、多样化的测评基准和自适应传感器选择策略。

Method: 构建包含视觉挑战、激光雷达退化、轮滑和GNSS失效模式的M3DGR基准数据集；评估40个SLAM系统性能；设计一个多传感器融合框架Ground-Fusion++，集成GNSS、RGB-D、激光雷达、IMU和轮式里程计。

Conclusion: 本文通过数据集和多传感器融合框架解决了SLAM系统在复杂环境中鲁棒性不足的问题，推动了SLAM算法在实际应用中的可靠性发展。

Abstract: Considerable advancements have been achieved in SLAM methods tailored for
structured environments, yet their robustness under challenging corner cases
remains a critical limitation. Although multi-sensor fusion approaches
integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the
research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of
standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM
algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive
performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks
primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively
addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental
conditions.
  To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce
M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation
patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS
denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on
M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under
challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular
multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust
performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and
wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着卫星自主操作的增加，传统PD控制器和现有深度强化学习算法难以满足实时适应和容错需求。

Method: 结合TD3、回溯经验回放（HER）和维度裁剪（DWC）形成TD3-HD算法，用以提升稀疏奖励环境下的学习效果。

Result: 与PD控制和其他主流DRL算法相比，TD3-HD在故障条件下大幅降低姿态误差，提高角速度调节能力和系统稳定性。

Conclusion: TD3-HD具备作为自主卫星姿态控制中的强大容错AI解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D mapping suffers from cumulative drift causing global
misalignment, particularly in GNSS-constrained environments. To address this,
we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for
high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal
alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via
extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions
Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure
detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors
followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a
large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to
facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000
frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS
trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess
geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on
road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy.
Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m,
achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a
wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data
integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method,
and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping
in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released
publicly.

Conclusion: 本文方法有效解决了仿真与现实机器人末端执行器位置不一致的问题，提高了机器人控制的准确性。

Abstract: When inverse kinematics (IK) is adopted to control robotic arms in
manipulation tasks, there is often a discrepancy between the end effector (EE)
position of the robot model in the simulator and the physical EE in reality. In
most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about
joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only
available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this
difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front
of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real
environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific
points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we
build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation
and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from
any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate
that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly
reducing positioning errors.

Abstract: Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy
has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance,
efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while
end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability.
Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based
task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector
velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address
these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic,
velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a
multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for
locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy
to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a
twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses
and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation
and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm.
The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and
shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in
extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS方法为人机交接任务提供了一种新颖且高效的视觉表征方法，克服了从模拟到真实的视觉域差距，实现了无真实机器人训练的机器人操作政策学习。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

Conclusion: 利用动态博弈理论和主动防御机制，紫色代理为大语言模型的安全防护提供了一种有效且理论支撑的方法，有助于缓解越狱风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

Motivation: 传统博弈理论假设完全理性且效用最大化的智能体，现实中智能体的理性受限，因此需要一个能刻画有限理性的模型。

Method: 将推理提示作为策略空间，定义推理均衡，其中行为由LLM推理输出决定，显式建模推理过程，并考虑认知约束和认知模式。

Result: 通过示例展示了推理均衡与经典Nash均衡的偏离，揭示了新形式战略互动的可能性。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash为利用LLM的系统中理性受限的战略交互提供了新基础，有助于理解和设计具有限制理性的智能体交互。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: There is growing interest in giving AI agents access to cryptocurrencies as
well as to the smart contracts that transact them. But doing so, this position
paper argues, could lead to formidable new vectors of AI harm. To support this

more technical research aimed at preventing and mitigating these harms and,
thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart

TL;DR: 该论文综述并分析了溯因推理在不同领域及计算系统中的应用，指出现有理论和系统均未充分支持创造性假设的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同领域对溯因推理的理解存在差异，而现有理论和计算实现未能有效支持创造性假设的生成，亟需深入研究。

Method: 首先综述溯因推理在认识论、科学和设计中的讨论，然后分析计算系统中溯因推理的实现，最后将计算系统分解为构件，提出未来研究方向。

Result: 发现理论框架缺乏生成创造性溯因假设的明确模型，计算系统主要实现了类三段论的溯因推理。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究应专注于推动计算系统中创造性溯因推理的发展。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对具备工具使用能力的自治大型语言模型代理的统一安全对齐框架，旨在应对用户和工具两个渠道的安全威胁，通过结构化推理和沙箱强化学习提升代理的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对自治大型语言模型代理在执行外部工具时面临的新型安全风险，包括用户发起的对抗性提示和工具产生的恶意输出，传统对话安全防护手段不足以应对，亟需一种统一框架保障工具使用代理的安全。

Method: 引入三模态分类（良性、恶意、敏感）用于用户提示和工具响应，设计策略驱动的决策模型；构建定制的沙箱环境模拟真实工具执行，实现细粒度奖励塑造；结合结构化推理与沙箱强化学习训练安全对齐的代理模型。

Conclusion: 该研究表明安全性与效能可被同时优化，为自治大型语言模型代理的可信部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在动态空间交互方面表现欠佳，而这一能力对实际应用至关重要，因此需要提升模型在空间推理方面的能力。

Method: 采用新颖的数据生成管道构建高质量推理数据集（共294.2K样本），并引入动态多任务训练策略及逐步优化，结合任务特定奖励信号以解决数据间冲突并提升训练效果。

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B在8个基准测试中均刷新了性能记录，表现出卓越的通用推理和空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的数据和训练方法，M2-Reasoning-7B成功弥补了多模态大语言模型在空间推理上的缺陷，推动了该领域技术的进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

Motivation: 将伦理纳入需求获取过程对于开发符合伦理的系统至关重要，但传统手工伦理需求获取受限于时间、资源及利益相关者多样性，且常被忽视。

Method: 设计一个伦理倡导代理人在多智能体大语言模型设置中，基于系统描述对伦理问题进行批判并提出建议，形成伦理需求草案。

Result: 通过两个不同背景的案例研究验证，该框架能涵盖大部分人工访谈中识别的伦理需求，并且还能补充若干新的相关需求。同时揭示了生成伦理需求的可靠性问题，强调了人类反馈的重要性。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于促进伦理在需求工程中的广泛应用，推动开发更多符合伦理标准的产品。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Conclusion: 提出的双层框架有效提升了推理准确性和透明度，为基于大语言模型的可靠系统化推理提供了有力途径。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Motivation: 罕见病诊断受限于知识表示深度不足、概念理解有限以及临床推理能力不足。

Method: 通过多粒度稀疏激活医疗概念，结合三层（分类学、临床特征、实例）分层知识图谱，利用四种匹配算法、多样性控制和五级回退策略实现精准激活。

Result: 在BioASQ罕见病问答数据集上显著提升了BLEU（+0.09）、ROUGE（+0.05）和准确率（+0.12），最高准确率达到0.89，接近临床阈值0.90。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了信息质量、推理能力和专业表达，有望缩短罕见病患者的诊断周期。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

Motivation: 由于大量历史生物样本缺乏地理定位，且复杂的地名描述使自动标注极具挑战，现有自动方法未能有效利用地图信息。

Method: 使用大型多模态自回归模型结合基于网格的策略，实现模型对地理描述中空间关系的视觉上下文理解，实现零样本地理定位。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

TL;DR: 本文评估了结构化多智能体系统（MAS）与双智能体系统（2AS）在早期工程设计任务中的性能差异，聚焦于需求提取、功能分解及仿真代码生成。MAS通过引入设计状态图（DSG）实现更细粒度的设计表示，实验结果显示MAS生成的设计图更为详细，且推理蒸馏模型提升了任务完成率，但总体需求覆盖率和代码兼容性仍有待提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在早期复杂工程设计中的连续性维护和生成可执行模型方面存在困难，亟需更有效的系统架构来提升设计流程的管理能力。

Method: 提出设计状态图（DSG）作为需求、实体和物理模型的JSON序列化表示，构建包含九角色的多智能体系统（MAS）与两个角色的系统（2AS）进行对比，分别采用两种大型语言模型并在不同参数条件下运行60次实验，评估设计流程效果。

Result: 两系统均保持高质量的JSON和实体标签，但需求覆盖低于20%，代码兼容性在2AS特定设置下达100%，MAS平均低于50%。推理蒸馏模型更可靠地标识流程完成。MAS生成了更多细粒度的设计节点，提升设计详细度。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体系统可以提升工程设计的细节表达，推理蒸馏模型有助于提高任务完成率，但整体需求覆盖不足及代码质量仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Result: 相较于前版本，Leanabell-Prover-V2在MiniF2F测试集上性能提升3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: 利用验证器反馈指导的强化学习显著提升了基于LLM的形式化定理证明性能，展示了自我纠错机制的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

Motivation: 现有AI代理利用复杂的提示工程和外部推理框架与LLM交互，但受限于LLM在理解自然语言的固有限制，且迭代推理成本高昂。

Method: 设计了INoT框架，通过引入LLM-Read代码提示，使LLM能够执行程序化对话推理，在其内部实现自我否认与反思。

Result: 在六个基准测试的三个任务上，INoT平均性能提升7.95%，且令牌消耗比表现最佳的基线方法低58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT有效提升了基于LLM的AI代理推理性能和效率，且具备在图像理解和推理领域的多功能性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is
highly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted
applications. However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated
approaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including
increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges,
surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization
utilizing Gaussian process models have emerged.
